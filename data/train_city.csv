0; Amazing game
0;" the game is good providing you dont make a foolish mistake like accidently delete a core road or power/water supply whilst you are in debt - incredibly difficult to recover as there is no ""undo"" and you cannot then replace the item until you are back in the green $$$. constant unhappy city due to my mistake and it takes me HOURS to recover as the debt just spirals out of control. ive made this mistake twice now and it is just really punishing for such a simple error. no longer enjoying skylines and now looking for a way to cheat/mod to overcome this."
0;" As someone who struggles a lot with anxiety, I have to say that this game was the best accidental discovery I have made this year thus far.This game not only allows for you to freely exercise one's creativity on a blank canvas: It also allows for backtracks (as long as you save your city :p). Whatever that you imagine, this game allows you to put into reality and see how extreme you can bring it.In my short time that I have played this game, I have found myself hooked because of how well it takes my mind off of worrying matters. This game is like my anchor.However, it does have one bad thing about it -- DLCs. Just to unlock different features requires you to purchase so many DLCs. Quite... microtransaction-esque.But great game overall!"
2; It needs more lane my traffic is crumbling
0; best city builder game ever
0; very good game
0; best way to end your day
0; you can bulldoze peoples houses if they complain about taxes 10/10 would reduce the population again
1;" Only played game for a little over an hour. After that session, I have not been able to play the game again. Steam says it running, but I do not see the game running in my Task manager & steam refusing to provide a refund, as the application shows that I have played for then 2 hours. Steam has been no help on trying to get help."
0; City Building at its finest.
0; A great city builder where you can turn poop into infinite power
0; Recreated my own suburb. Had the same problems in game and in real life.
0;" Simple premise but hard to master, it is awesome and fun if you like watching an expanding city at the touch of a few buttons"
0; good
0; i like it
0; so much better than console omg i love build city
0;" built a city with only trains as method of transport, i like trains."
0; Little bit too hard for me but i like it!
0; Its simply one of the best city building games out there. Both the developers and the modding community have worked so hard to make this game become much more than anyone could have originally imagined.
0; its fun
0; very good the controls are wierd tho
0; City game!
1;" you know what, i was waiting sreen loading 2 hour, yes it's 2 fk hour and i cant login this game, fk this game"
0;" This game is incredibly addictive once you grasp the basic rules. Despite the trial and error, it has this way of captivating you and keeping you hooked. You won't even realize that you've spent 5 hours just navigating through it, lol."
0; this is the best i played 166 min when i frist got it its the best city game
2; I love Paradox but they seriously need to chill on the ludicrously overpriced DLC's. At least make a pack of them for a reasonable price. Seriously this game is trapped behind a pay wall at this point. Otherwise great game ruined by greed.
0;" Very good game, I just hope you have space on your C drive"
0; great.
0; the coolest game i've ever played
1; I built a mega cool city in one day but the next day when I tried to play it did not save
2;" The best city builder to date. And if you add to this a huge number of DLCs, as well as workshop with a lot of ideas from community - you will have everything that you need to build the city of your dreams.PS - waiting for CS2 I hope it will be no worse than the first part"
0; good game but wait for 2nd one.
0; I love cities skylines
0;" The simulation is really forgiving compared to SC4, with some basic city planning concepts you can manage 30k-50k city within a few hours. DLC is kind of expensive, but not necessary. Power delivery is still kind of confusing."
0; this is a negative review in preparation for cities skylines 2
0; I like the game play
0;" Great game, but your city is doomed to die to the brain dead driving AI in this game, unless you install 10 different driving AI mods and spend 20 extra hours just planning roads."
0;" Cities: Skylines is a fun, challenging, yet relaxing game that can be played for hours and hours on end without any signs of bordem. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxed city building experience."
1;" when i want to re enter my saved game, it can not opened, says an error accured and nothing ."
0;" NO GAME COMPARES. Other than you know, but NOBODY does it better with the interface defaults. Beautiful and ROBUST engine and code make this a FOREVER GAME."
0;" Best city builder out there (until Cities: Skylines 2). So much to offer, especially with mods. Get lost in this amazing game."
2;" The game is awesome, but has so much DLCs. I love the work of the team but think that DLCs must be cheaper."
0;" best play high, i feel like a god and i dont know how to feel about it"
0; genre smashing game.
0; city game fun
0; Cities Skylines is soooo amazing i love it and has brought me many hours of happiness
0; It's really entertaining
0; i played for too long and i still can't make a good city.
0; I would highly recommend playing with a few mods on especially the ones who can help out with traffic and signage.
0; This game makes me want to run for mayor in real life.
0; Endless hours of peace and chaos.
0;" This game is not for perfectionists because I have had my times of anger at not knowing how to handle heavy traffic, but it is definitely such an enjoyable game that can eat the hours away.It is not as easy as it looks and it might be needed to search online for a few tactics and how things work like trains and others if the pressure is a lot, but it is essentially a sandbox for your imagination in terms of city planning. Super super good"
0; very good yes yes
0; Very fun game for people who enjoy geography or are into cities and town development. It's very enjoyable and I recommend it for anyone
0;" Pretty steep learning curve, but once you learn how the game works, it's pretty great. Also, modding community is amazing and super active."
0; just wait for the next one lol
0; I like building cities: skylines and am looking forward to building cities: skylines 2.
0; last 3 years I started play this game now I can make money
0; My residents hate taxes more than living next to poop rivers. Very realistic
0;" Don't start this game. It's too addicting. You may say you're only going to play for an hour before bed, next thing you know, the sun is coming up. If you want that kind of addiction to game play for this little money, don't say you weren't warned."
0; obviously I recommend it... its my most played game... If you like city builders this is a must
0; FUn game but a little complicating sometime
0; try not to kill everyone
0; its pretty cool ig man idk
0;" I have honestly no idea how I have the ability to review the game on Steam as I don't own it on steam (I own it on Epic Games as it was free there so there isn't really that much of a point in buying it here), but I can safely say that this game is amazing. I have several hundreds of hours on the game (Again, different platform) and it genuinely just doesn't get boring.Then there's the mods, and oh boy are the mods good. If you get bored of the game, try it with mods and trust me, you will find the game fun again. There is no end to what the mods in this game can do.I absolutely cannot wait for Cities: Skylines 2"
1; THE MAP EDITOR DONT WORK ANYMORE HOPEFULLY THE LAZY DEVELOPERS WILL FIX IT SOON IF YOU CREATE A MAP AND FINISH IT THEN START NEW GAME WITH IT THE MAP CRASHES AND YOU GET ERROR MESSAGES SAYING ERROR NBKGNBGJOBNGJBNBJGNBJGN HEY LAZY DEVELOPERS FIX THIS BUG
0; harder than sims. uses your brain. makes your pc literally a stove
1; Really Fun only downside is the sometimes glitchieness of landscaping
0; Allows loved playing the game!
0; i like to make canals going down hills with sewage dumps at the top so it becomes a sewer-slide
0; my dad plays it
0;" Very fun, if it isn't fun for you, just download mods. Trust me."
0;" I know I'm not alone in saying that City Skylines has been a great inspiration for me in studying road layouts and city design. The way this game hit the scene is nothing shy of historic, and I wouldn't be surprised if 20 years from now it will be common to hear traffic engineers talk about how it was City Skylines that sparked their interest in the field."
0; watch a few tutorials and your good to go
0; Cant have enough of this
0; The only game that makes you think about getting 64gb ram for your system.
0;" Fun game, and it's even better with mods like move it and others."
0;" Fits well into the ""oddly satisfying"" category. It's not only building districts, but you build a whole city. Sandbox/Unlimited funds makes funds easy if you're just wanting to build, which is what suits my fancy more. Otherwise, it's fun to see the districsts build up and your city grow."
0; i like to terrorize my citizens
0;" Nice game, nice mods"
0;" It can be a little complicated first, it took me a while to understand that the tutorial it's in the game and it's teaching you every time you start a new world. But it's kinda look a like IRL you can spend a good amount of time creating."
0; I like playing cities alot. I have Cerebral Palsy and use a HeadMouse to work the computer. Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse. Its hard finding games that I can play because I don't have use of my hands. I would recomme it to anyone with a disability.
0; I JUST WANNA LIKE IT
0;" My first city went bankrupt, the second was washed away by flood (don't ask), third drowned in sewage, my fourth and current city (as of this writing) is doing fine but city layout is horrible - traffic jams everywhere."
0; Good city building games and I can run it smoothly on mac
0;" gud game, lacks the ability (without network anarchy mod) to build a road to hell"
0; lets me simulate the real experience of designing an urban sprawl hellscape and gaslight my residents into being happy
0;" Excellent city-builder since Sim City went down the toilet ages agoBeware Paradox DLCificationExcited for the sequel, shut up and take my money though"
0;" Colossal order releases a city-building simulator. Millions of copies sold. A couple of months later developer makes an announcement:""We are sorry, that we didn't include tunnels and European buildings in the initial release of the game. Here, take them for free""."
0;" I'm a 50-year-old gamer republican trump guy (fr fr on god) and I love playing this game and have come to understand the importance of good, efficient public transit and walkable cities"
0; hgmjf
0; Played the free weekend. Was only gonna play it to see if anything changed. Five hours later I looked up and realized it was dark out and I really needed to pee. This game is so soothingly addictive.
1;" Say's I played the game 16 hours, but I've not seen a single bit of it except the launcher. Game freezes upon start up. I've done everything down to deleting and reinstalling the launcher. Steam is fraudulent and counted NON gameplay time as time so now I also get denied a refund because the game won't start and isn't even recording game time properly. Tbh, it's super sad. I really wanted to play this game, but if it's not as simple as buy it, install, play you shouldn't be on the market. It's called fraud."
1; Unplayable for me. I've been trying to play this game for months using a very small amount of popular mods. I'll spend an hour trying to set up the game and it will crash 30 min into game-play. Bought a lot of DLC's at this point and I have not even been able to play the last two I bought.
0; Can't wait for the sequel! I do wish there weren't so many DLCs. I wish there were a subscription model like with HOI4
0;" Great game, even without the all of the DLCs which of course make the game better in my opinion."
0;" Played for hours without realizing it, very satisfying trying to find balance."
0; Just a very relaxing and creative game
0; someone complained that the city had high tax rates so i bulldozed their house10/10 no one has complained ever since
0; Good and creative game
0;" The first thing is the graphics are very good. Well, The game play will have you on the game for hours. There is so much to do in this game you will not get bored with.I have made a number of different city though the years that I have been playing and it hasn't gotten old to me yet If you like managing and making a city the way you like. Bingo ! this game is for you."
0;" If you have ADHD, Good luck getting Lost in this game like i did <3"
0; extremly fun and a great game full of good things like healthcare police fire brigades and good looking lightning would recomend
0;" This is an amazing game, it can be weird and glitchy but it creates it all the more fun."
0; The Only City Builder
0; I think it's a great game.The game has a lot of freedom.You can add any DLC you want.Free to build your own city.
0; I likes it a lot
0; 2nd best city game i love how not laggy it is
0; good game and good dlcs reccomed buying the industries dl very good
0; At this point this is a really badly built core of a game that relies too much on mods to get it into good working order. I'll wait for the sequel and hope it's not as shoddily built as this one.
0; It's a great game and really fun. I wish the vanilla game came with better features so you don't have to use mods as much though.
0; so nice watching the empty land turn into city of your design and trying to manage problems
0;" I made my citizens adopt recycling (If you know, you know)"
0;" SUPER GAME , BUT DLCs required to have more fun"
0; Very satisfying when u get to a point that organization pays off.
0; im a bad city planner but they all love me
0; It combines the scratch for my ADHD itch with Zen gardening
0; this game is so creative and cool
0; More addictive than cocaine
1; Cool Game. The medic stuff is buggy though.
0; Build your own city what could be more fun then that?! I recommend this game so much if you love building this is the game for you Im so Hooked on it i cant wait for the second one to come out!
0; it is soooo fun
0; Cities IMO has a steep learning curve but is heaps and bounds better than SimCity. With cities 2 coming out I would wait for that but great game.
0;" really fun game, runs realy well, and is super detailed"
0;" In This Game,You Don't Make A Succesfull City The All The Time,And I Learned That Even When You Work Hard You Don't Make A Successfull Community Every Time.But,I Like A Good Challenge.How About You?"
0; Great City Builder
0;" Fun game to kill time. Unlike most simulators, this game gives you a certain amount of difficulty. Best advice, you don't need to cater to every single need of the residents, but always plan your city ahead before trouble comes in."
0; Really good game
0; What day is it?
0;" I've had Cities from jump. I've always enjoyed it. I would recommend with some mods the base game does not have. Cities 2 is coming out in October. Maybe wait until then but the base game is cheap until the 13th. Buy. Enjoy until 2 comes out. Either way, I've loved this game."
0;" I’ve been completely consumed by Cities: Skylines.. It’s everything that SimCity should have been.. There are massive maps, a simulation that appears to work very well, a great interface, lovely visuals, an editor and the ability to really mod the game properly.."
1;" the most infuriating game I've ever played-mods are always partially broken-traffic and pedestrians seem... floaty? They always float around the pathways and roads-the cars' bodyroll is severely dramatised-you can't place buildings by themselves, you have to make a residential/commercial/industrial zone and buildings get built just like that-cars don't need parking: cars just stop in the middle of the road (while blocking the rest of traffic), disappear and the passengers just walk off to where they want to go-the ""sound effects"" are VERY annoying: buildings constantly make these beep-boop sounds-the base game is so boring and empty. You want to make a tram network? Well then you have to buy the Snowfall DLC! Oh, now you want more in-depth industry? Well, you have to buy the Industries DLC! What, now you want to build your own airport? WELL, now you have to buy the Airports DLC!-the chirper app is unecessary-there's always, ALWAYS, a demand for something: residential zoning, commercial zoning or industrial zoningI could go on and on for hours, but there's no point since this game is going to get abandoned once the sequel comes out anyway.You want to play a real city builder? Buy Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic. It's a bit more expensive than C:S but it already has trams, trolleybuses, in-depth industry and demand, free-form airports and such. It only has one DLC which is, actually, a fundraiser for Ukraine and includes some unique buildings and vehicles from Ukraine.TL:DR: do not buy C:S."
0;" It's one of those game that you will binge for 10 to 15 hours straight, and then never play it again for months only to pick it up again."
0;" great game,. just sucks il have to buy mods all over again. not good."
0; One of the best city builder game I have been played so Far
2;" Please incorporate built-in fillers such as plazas, concrete, cobbles, asphalt, etc., and include the ability to modify the plaza of an existing building, At least do it for CS II. In actual cities, you wouldn't find empty grass spaces between two high-rises."
0; Can see myself playing 500+ hours easily. Can't believe it took so long for me to play this perfect game. 5/5 Stars. Big expectations for the next title.
0; This game rules if you like building and being rewarded for good management. If those aren't for you then I would skip it.
0; Never gets old.
0;" If you like building games, this is one of the best. Part 2 is dropping soon and I cannot wait. Must buy for anyone who likes to build."
0; Good game experiences
0; The ultimate city building game.
0; I drowned a city in poop. Amazing game reccomend 10/10
0; nothing really bad to say
0; more addictive than tik tok
0;" If you are into city building games, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic franchise that helps you build one from the ground up. From managing roadways and transportation, to arranging different districts for your citizens, to building utilities, budgeting loans and taxes versus income earned, and overall just making sure that there's a balance between them all, Cities Skylines is a great way to practice how to build a good city. There's design, there's practicality, there's the weather and climate factor, and a whole bunch of stuff in between.Hours of fun of just building and rebuilding, and imagining how to make the perfect city."
0;" You have no idea how many hours you will spend in this game trying to figure out why the cars are so dumb, why people clog up specific subway stops, and how in the heck they use up so much water.And you'll do it all without even noticing you're doing it."
0; I have driven my city to near bankruptcy numerous times: I feel like the Big Guy back in 1999. I'm happy.
0;" pretty fun once you get the hang of it. imo the basics and tutorial are a bit hard to understand for a newcomer, altho i might just be illiterate and or brain dead. also y'all do know that there's other city planning techniques aside from the grid system, right?"
0;" I'd reccomend it so much, i'd buy it for you"
0; It's the Simcity we always wanted. Best city builder ever made!!!
0; Anyone who likes builder games will love this one! Well worth the money!
1;" Pretty broken on mac. Paradox launcher doesn't work, bypassing the launcher doesn't work either, since the game needs the launcher to update properly. Don't buy if you have a mac."
0; its goooood
0;" In my humble opinion, this is one of the best games ever created. Unlimited replay value due to mod support and one heck of a vanilla game that is flexible, yet well structured. Excellent game that each of the DLCs has made better!"
0;" Simply put, the quintessential city building game."
1; Crashes all the time or doesn't work at all
0; cool game
0; This game slaps
0; I liked how you could build a city
0;" It is a really good game, just have a movie on and take care of your cities hell yeah!"
0;" It's a really fun game, I prefer playing with infinite money because I can fool around with things."
0;" This is one of the best simulation games I've ever played and it the best city building game of all time (at the time I am posting this, Cities Skylines II comes out in October 2023). I highly recommend this game it to people, as long as they understand a few things.DLCs- One big negative about this game is the large paywall for content. So many features of the game are held behind DLC, that you can't get the full experience without buying at least some of them.Modding- Cities Skylines has the biggest modding community I've ever seen. I personally wouldn't play the game without some of the crucial mods, such as Traffic Manager, Fine Road Anarchy, and more. Mods enhance the game by so much, its almost impossible to play without them.Efficiency & Performance- Because of the games age, this game does not run very well. It's single threaded, meaning it will be bottle necked even on the best of computers. Also, it eats ram like there is no tomorrow, especially if you have a lot of mods and assets. Don't be fooled by the minimum requirements, you are going to need at least 16 gbs of ram to play.Learning curve- The game isn't super difficult, but it certainly isn't a walk in the park at first. You will have to learn how to manage traffic, which is the main killer of cities. There are plenty of solutions, such as public transport (DLC), walking paths, and better road networks, but you will have to test and experiment to succeed in this game.I could go on and on, but those are my main points. So in conclusion, its a great game, and I recommend it to people if they understand the things above."
0;" I love the game but strongly hate the publisher. If you are willing to buy the barebones of a game and then give them 150 € and more in addition, you will probably have a great time."
0;" This Game Is fun tho but yeah,you know you need some decent set up for this game but it was worth it"
0; surely one of the best city builders out there. a lot of content and even more stuff from workshop. in my opinion DLCs are too expensive tho
0;" The game's depth and enjoyable gameplay provide a fulfilling experience for city management enthusiasts, setting it apart from similar titles. However, it's important to consider the role of downloadable content (DLC) in extending the game's lifespan and offering additional features. Furthermore when considering the potential purchase of downloadable content (DLC) for the game, it's crucial to take a thoughtful approach. Before diving into acquiring DLCs, it's important to reflect on your personal preferences, priorities, and budget. Assess the specific content that the DLC offers and evaluate how it aligns with your gameplay desires and expectations, otherwise your gameplay will significantly handicapped."
0; citying skylining
0;" Mesmerizing. Some gameplay issues, a bit of a early learning curve, but once you get it it's hard to stop playing."
0; Cities: Skylines is a great game and it is extremely addictive!
0; Best sucessor to Sim City 4 witch all mechanic and economics
0; love
0; Without a doubt one of the best City Builders of all time. The price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the Steam workshop. I'm so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game. The Developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players. Thanks CO!
0; I like playing god
0; A very nice game to build citys and destroy them
0; This game really is the perfect squeal to SimCity
0; i liked the fact that has endless possibilities
0; Arguably the best city builder out there. The sheer amount of customisation and workshop items available means you can build anything from a village to a thriving metropolis. Definitely one to get if you are a city builder fan.Edit: I pretty much played nothing but this game for a good couple of years!
0;" One of my residents started spouting some bourgeois ♥♥♥♥ about our region's farming industry via the in-game Twitter feed.Fortunately, the game was able to immediately show me their whereabouts so I bulldozed their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ home and built a cow pasture on it."
2;" Enjoyable game, totally worth the money, I wanna get more DLC's, the add so much to the game"
0; mantap bet dsikon 78 rebu
0; If you like City Builders then this is the king of them all.
0;" Most complex and yet simple city builder out there!With loads of community assets and mods, and official DLC's this game can be played at any level"
0;" Nothing much to it, this is the definitive civil engineering title."
0; Excellent. Addictive!
0; w
0; gud
0; check out the mod library for essential quality of life plugins: looking forward to the release of next version!
0; gnarly charlie
0; you can build city :D
0;" Kind of fun, but gets repetitive quickly."
0;" Great game - Even simply to pass the time. But also to allow your utmost creativity to flourish. Great game, worth the investment 100%."
0;" Really fun, lots of options"
1; i cant even tell if this game is good beacsue when i try to start up the game it WON'T EVEN LOAD.fix this and i will give a thumbs up
0; I mostly liked the cities part but the skylines were okay too
1;" Wondering if i can get any support, tried for 6 hours to get this working nobody will reply on anything. when i try to launch the game i get exit code null and some waffle about c++ resomething or other."
0;" Trains, trams, bike lanes, all the public transport you wish your irl town had."
0;" good game, very hard tho."
0;" It's a game I bought many years ago. I bought it because I enjoy city-building games like this, and I haven't been disappointed. You'll be perplexed by many things at first, and you'll simply want to check each of the things you can do with the game until you get to the point where you're watching people's videos on YT about how they're able to construct such interesting and awesome cities within the game."
0; Pretty fun and nice looking
0;" Great game, bad DLC policy"
0; Fantastic!!!
0;" very detailed, good game!"
0; God complex
0; I love the game its very fun (Tip for new players) Knock down peoples houses if they are complaining even the slightest
1; why my city skyline not working plz help
0; I'm sorry to all of the people that have lived in my cities
0; Very good. I like it. My dog likes it
0;" i love it, i genuuinely feel like the council government of the city"
0; i blew up my city
0; fire game i came on it
0; fun to play when bored
0;" Probably one of the best city building games on the market. It has its issues (don't ask about hydro mechanics), but for the most part it is a lot of fun and reminds me of the long ago Sim City days of the early 2000's."
0;" In comparison to other city building games, this game is intended for you to build your own city, even if it occasionally lacks the designs or items you wish to incorporate within your city. However, I recently discovered that a new one called ""Cities: Skylines II"" is on the way, so I'm looking forward to it and hoping that they will give me a discount because I'm a poor gamer."
0;" great game all around, no serious issues i can think of other that than building upwards with terrain"
0; Amazing game with a lot of community and developer support -the amount of DLCs can be nauseating though-
0; Cities Skylines is a great game and I'm looking forward to the second one!
0;" Super fun, preety easy to leran, try seeing the tutorial after you start developing your first city, for fun and more interesting gameplay. hope you'll have fun playing the game as I did. I started two weeks ago and I love it. Good times for all of you !"
0;" Great game, everything is great"
0; I am obsessed
2;" The game is the best of the type but they should update the engine, it's very outdated and makes the game feels very laggy despite the hardware resources being available. I hope they do that in the form of an update (like the guys from Euro Truck do) and not as a new game. The community is amazing, they share all kinds of great mods and assets that keep evolving to make our gaming experience better. While it says I have 400 hours or so, I actually have more than 4k hours since I played it from the time they released it but outside of steam. I hope the devs don't give up on this game, we need that engine update :)"
0;" Me happy, me get complaint from Sharon Peters, me sad, me find peters residence, me bulldoze peters residence, me happy"
0; I played it. I like it. I recommend it.
0; Was good at the start but became another Paradox dlc cash grab
2; Game provides many opportunities for creativity and fun. Wish more features were given for free and you didn't have to purchase every DLC
1; this version does not allow for mods.
0;" I absolutely freaking love this game, it’s way better than simcity, just the graphics are amazing"
0; Nice To chill.It is fun to watch society burn
0; Uses a launcher that is slow and causes issues.
0; This is a MUST have game if you're into simulators. I put this game off for years and instead played SimCity and that was a mistake. The mods via workshop are so amazing and make the game that much more enjoyable.I've already pre-ordered Cities Skylines 2. There's no doubt in my mind it'll be a fantastic game.
0; Is a fun game too try out but can be hard too.
0; wow so cool
0; Quite nice game.
0; Has a lot of variety in what you can do and you can make almost any choices you want. You control a whole city and it is fun but can become tedious. Also can be a little confusing
0;" like SimCity4, but better UX"
0;" This is the best city building game ever created. That being said, skip it for C:S 2"
0; Its difficult enough that you don't get bored within an hour.
0; my civilians drank their own poop
0;" This game is addictive, super fun, and really well designed. Cannot recommend enough if you enjoy city builder, strategy, or similar genres of games!"
0;" I remember playing Sim City when I was a kid but their last iteration was complete garbage. In walks Cities Skylines like a breath of fresh air. The base game will give you days of entertainment but then with all the dlc and mods, there's so much to do. I studied city planning in college and this is as close to that profession as I'll ever get. I can spend hours playing and when I'm done, there's a calming effect to the game. I wasn't too keen on first because you couldn't have a farming community (which is the largest part of the United States) but after the industrial dlc, I'm completely satisfied. I love spending hours building a city then I go to bed and plan out a campus or transportation system as I fall asleep. I play a ton of other games but when I can't decide what to play or nothing else sounds good, Cities Skylines is always my go-to. The number of options for roads, paths, and buildings means you never get tired of the same building/road/path being built 1000 times in the same city. I also like how you can expand into different areas of your choice as the city grows. It leaves the whole planning/simulation process up to the user. I can't wait for Citie Skylines 2 but unlike this game which will run on most computers, my fear is the sequel will need a boosted system to work. I've run this game easily on the highest settings on a computer built in 2017"
0;" With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best.Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!"
0; great game. I can’t wait for the sequel.
0; Spent 2000 of my 2022 hours played in the Workshop.
0; i would say yes but it gets boring really fast
0; Almost the ultimate city builder! Just play it.

0; BEST CITY BUILDING GAME EVER!!!!
1;" Bought game around Thanksgiving 2022. Played a little. The game was fun to play. Tried opening game in March 2023. Will not load. Why did Paradox break the game? They need to get their act together and fix it. Will not purchase Paradox products in the future. It is extremely annoying to see something that works fine one day suddenly not work at all. And what do they offer? A long list of items explaining how to fix it. And no, they did not work for me. Waste of money."
0;" If you love watching your city grow, definitely give this game a play."
0; i am god
0;" fun game, not enough houses"
2; Just anounce (or release) CS2 already instead this endless stream of bs DLCs. And fix the retarded traffic AI when you plan on releasiing the follow up.
0; Best city building game though would buy right now(as of 7/12/23) due to CS 2 being only a few months away from release.
1;" I have installed this game a few times on different computer setups, i5-8600k now on my 5800x3D on a 3090 video card, and it still crashes every time I try starting it. Cannot recommend this game for it being un-playable on multiple computers."
0; very gut game
0;" The best in the business, soon to be replaced with its sequel. Its hard to recommend this game knowing C:S II comes out in October, but I've put so much time into this game that I can't help but recommend it."
0; The amount of modding support in this game makes it possible to do practically anything.
0; 40 percent traffic flow
0; angsty teens must play
0; my citizens died because of poop in tap water
0;" I started playing Cities back in 2016. Played 600+ hours in the last 7 years. If you're a simulation strategical creative micro-manager fanatic like me, this game is close to perfect. Will absolutely be buying Cities Skylines II later this year. As well as every DLC I can get my hands on. What can I say? I will never get bored of being god-mode mayor."
0; nice game. worth every penny spend.
0; Phenomenal game. Very fun. Strongly recommend!
0;" Don't have a God complex, just be God"
1; game always crash when i open
0; Ah yes... I love Traffic Simulator!
0; To pass the time
0; yay
0; very enjoyable
0;" The best city building simulator since Sim City 4. Hopefully, sequel will be on par if not better."
0;" It's fun, innit?"
2; I wish you could build cities that weren't so car dependent
0; You can make poop lakes
0; this game is so fun i am actually adictid to the gameand its very fun for the pricebut i got it for 9$ but it usualy cost 30$but its good for the price.
0; I accidentally left it open and now it says 200 hours
0;" I spend way too many hours playing this game and generally enjoy it very much.As far as city builders go, this is one of the best and , with mods, you can build and create cities of all size and class.I mentioned, ""With Mods"" as one of minor problems with the game seems to be it's reliance on Mods to fully enjoy and utilise the gameplay to its potential.This isn't really a problem as there is more mods and user content available in the workshop to suit everybodys style of play (mostly).There's plenty of reviews stating all the glorious features etc etc players state this game has, and it is a great and enjoyable time waster :)I will point out some of the concerns I have with this game and unfortunately, these will probably be inherited with the new CS2 about to release.DLC required. The basic game is almost unplayable on its own for anyone who wish to fully create a city or larger town with any form of style or features. Everything from the transport systems, parks, industrial and commercial, tourism, entertainment, etc etc etc beyond overly simplified tokens offered in the original, REQUIRES paid DLCs. To buy the game atm with, what I'd call basic, required DLC still costs $150 to $220au and if you want the full experience then be prepared to shell out $400 to $500. (For a 8 year old game.) Ouch!I expect the CS 2 will be even more expensive but thats another story.The other issue is performance. This game requires a generous amount of ram, 16GB min to 32gb if you plan to run too many DLCs and creator content. I also needs a decent GPU with 8GB or more. Even then some systems will drop to 15 to 20 fps. On my current system I generally average around 50 to 80fps but my old system used to be 20 to 30. (I currently run AMD 7700X, 32GB and Radeon 6700XT. Old system was an old intel 10700 32gb and Strix 2060 which ran okay but a bit choppy)Lastly, stability. THe game has a tendency of crashing on a fairly regular time scale. A lot of this is from memory issues and certain addons. Even running no user addons can still cause some issues on smaller systems but a bulk of the problems are non updated addons. (Can't do much about that.)If you can afford the basic DLCs AND have a reasonable computer, and graphics card: AND can put up with the odd crash and loss of data: THEN I would highly recommend this game and be prepared to lose countless hours while diving headfirst in to this enthralling game.The only game so far I have found in the City builder type genre that come close to this would be the Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic, but more for the in depth realistic type players.Cities Skyline is a good game as a whole."
0; my time played speaks for itself
0; bad UI. not much fun. lags
0; this is a good game
0; Very in depth gameplay and great graphics.
0; I killed everyone in my city with sewage
0; It's very good in my experience and I like it so I'd say its a good game! Thanks Devs!
0; This game gave me severe Alzheimer's
0; fun gooddd!!!
0;" It's pure zen.So satisfying and relaxing watching your city grow from tiny houses into towering skyscrapers. Once your city is big enough you can just sit back, marvel at your creation and watch the money roll on in.There'll be that one resident who complains the taxes are too high.Bulldoze their house so they won't bother you anymore.You own these streets, they just live here!"
0; It's a bit boring
0;" Destroy, Build, Destroy"
0; I bulldozed an elementary school to make room for a highway.
0; By far the best city planning and building game. Can't wait for the second one.
0; Beautifully chaotic... A tragedy.
0; There is a steeper learning curve than most people let on but after learning the base game mechanic it can be so much fun.
0; Awesome city builder that took over the torch from Sim City 4
0; great game - can't wait for CS2
0;" EA, you paying attention?"
0; SimCity but all grown up
0;" paradox interactive launcher is the most pointless thing ever, who ever thought that was a good idea, please go eat a brick.other than that - half decent game. (will update review to be decent when cims learn how to change lanes properly)"
0;" Very enjoyable, has many different elements to take care of. I just wish you could have infinite districts of infinite city tiles, or at least a larger limit. Though I can see why there is a limit. Easily the game I've spent the most time in, and I don't regret it."
0;" If you are a fan of city-building games, Cities Skylines is a must-have. It is a game that will keep you hooked for hours as you watch your city grow and evolve."
0; I bought this game when back on 03/15/15 or just five days after the game was released onto Steam and I literally played for hours without end. I will soon average almost 200 hours of this game per year. This is one of the best investments I made back in the early days of this game. This is still one of my favorite games and the developers keep creating quality downloadable content. I will always continue to play this game. 
0; i literally upgrade my pc for this game
2;" Cities Skylines is what Sim City (2013) should have been. I'm trying to think of a downside besides the fact the there's not a Gold Edition [Edit 2/2017] YES THERE IS YEAH --out that bundles all of the expansions into a single game.--Build a city and manage traffic from the ground up, master the joy of constructing blocks, roads, interchanges, you name it. Balance power, services, education, pollution, everything you know a good City Builder needs.Then realize it's 3am and you have work in the morning."
0; love the detail you can go into when making your city. BEST city builder game ever played
1;" So the game used to work, but the broke it. Now there is a launcher and a new EULA and you can't even accept it. Game just crashes."
0;" BUILD CITY, HAVE FUN."
0; noice.
0; great game to make people suffer through a sewer river :D
0; Tight Learning curve but fun!
0; Really great game i would play it more often if i didn't have school.
0; Cities Skylines is a great game to idly spend time playing to relax a bit. That said once your city starts growing sometimes it can be a pain to keep up with the changes needed for it to run smoothly. Overall a great game for killing some free time.
0;" I have been playing this game for years. I started playing on Xbox One and eventually switched to PC. I have times where I don’t play it for a period of time but when I start it back up it’s an amazing experience. The graphics are not the best, but the overall experience is worth the purchase. I consider it a nice relaxing game."
0; You can make tsunami with ♥♥♥♥ water.Great game.
0; i cannot play this game in offline mode because launcher wth
0; just like the game
0;" boring when you're younger.addictive when you're older.yes, i ported the free epic games version onto steam, theres one problem.theres no water filtration"
0; Good way to spend time
0; Great and fun game
0;" great gameplay but insanely predatory DLC management, like every Paradox game sadly"
0; Takes a bit to get used to but very fun
0;" The hours I've spent on this game while in NYC covid lockdown has cemented the relationship. I like to build and solve problems, and the radio station is hillarious"
2;" I can't deal with this game... There's too many frustrating, horribly designed elements... like building themes and styles. Just make it easier to change the building themes please."
0; The fact that this game requires a solid thought process and a ton of RAM in order to be played: does not make me happy.
0; Love it. Very immersive game.
0; This game needs a sequel
0; Great game to get stuck into when life's got ya F**ked
0; i love it
0; Great game until everything goes wrong but that's what learning is for
1; Game repeatedly crashes losing all my towns. Beware that if you want a refund for this product you must not use if over 2 hours or Steam will refuse a refund! I am continuing to use it but need to save the game every few minutes or risk it crashing. Very frustrating!!
0; love playing you will get tied into it for hours
1;" crashes nonstop, doesnt open most of the time (i have a rtx2060 and i9), boring af without mods, a lot of bugs"
0;" It's ok, but I wouldn't care about it at all if there weren't mods and assets.Modding takes this game to an entirely different level and I consider more than 60 mods as essential and ""part of the game"" at this point. And it's constantly getting better."
1; very buggie more like a game that still being developed half the time something will go wrong like roads not registering or areas not registering either just don't get it not worth the money
0;" Immersive, detailed, fun and imaginative. Something I can play with my children as well as the ability to go into the management of resources in an simulated society."
0; Best thing since garlic bread. Hopefully Cities 2 will be better in everyway
0;" This game is addicting, enjoyable and with DLCs adds a whole another level of ""fix this"" and ""do that""! It's fun to build a city and try to fix issues, build whatever comes to mind, while keeping a realistic aspect inside (if you ignore the ass population mechanics and the small vanilla building sizes) and is so enjoyable to mod and tinker with. I first played cities skylines on the switch and had 0 idea what to do and killed thousands of people trying. When you immerse yourself in, you find frustration trying to figure out what's wrong, and find happiness when you figure it out, and get a sense of ""keep going"". This game is fun, addictive, and never feels boring as every time you click ""new game"", there's new maps, new things to do, new ways to do something, new things to unlock, and new experiences. Cities: Skylines is a Paradox Masterpiece. Just like HOI4, you never know how to do ANYTHING at the start and eventually get a hang of it, which gives you a feeling of pride and enjoyment."
0; This game is the reason why my wife hates me.
0;" good game thats really fun to do, the game does have some graphic problems. Have atleast 32GB of RAM and 10th generation of CPU or above, you can play below these specs but if your city gets to big you will experience issues, graphics cards dont really do much. Game is also severely expensive, without all the DLCs its gonna be boring, make sure to atleast get a few.Unplayable without the steam workshop make sure to hit that up"
0;" simply an incredible city builder sim game with unlimited possibilities. with the mod & custom assets community, you can literally do anything. play in your own sandbox, or play by the books and realistically manage everything about the city (electricity, noise pollution, education levels, traffic, etc.), or make gorgeous themed cities with custom assets and mods."
0; this game is fine until you mess 1 thing up and everyone is dead 8/10
0; Just a fun and relaxing game.
0;" Pretty challenging, but love the plethora of mods and some of the DLCs are fun enough if you enjoy the game and want to pay a little more."
0;" Oh, look. I got Cities Skyline in my humble bundle. Not sure if I'll like the game...12 hours later...Just gotta get a University down and THEN I'll quit for the night.Pros:1. Excellent Tools - almost everything is easy enough to use, but hard to master. Just like any good tool should be.2. Visual Appeal - This game looks great! And it's not a new game anymore.3. Satisfying Mechanics - I normally dislike progression systems, but the ones here works well (with a few exceptions). The city logic makes sense.4. Mods Mods Mods!Cons:1. It's really, really dense. I had trouble with this game until I had a chance to play Surviving Mars. Then the mechanics ""clicked"" better.2. Some systems could use a WAY better explanation in the early game. For example, it would be great to have a better idea that early road placement is critical to avoid early-mid game wall (of traffic).3. Beginner mistakes mean lots of complete restarts. It can be frustrating. I recommend to bail at the slightest sign of trouble rather than trying to duke out a bad situation.4. The simulation itself - There is a day and night, but ""night"" is multiple ""days"" long and it takes ""days"" for people to transport themselves just across the city in clear traffic. It's weird, I don't like it.5. Traffic AI is abhorrent. Thank heavens it doesn't simulate crashes. Designing roads in Vanilla (without mods) requires a different approach from real life. Intersections and complex road junctions should be avoided in favor of interchanges and merges. Even the suburban grid requires ""tricks"" to get working right.Despite all the cons, I love this game. I just hope that the next iteration includes a much better tutorial and more accurate simulation."
0; great time always updating
0; This game made me realize how hard it is to run Detroit.
0; I love how easy it is to do things! i dont like that the people dont have enough customers though
0; solving traffic has never been easy
0; Its the best city builder game i've played and the mods you can download is the best
0; Literally unplayable without mods
0; Ran out of content 10 hours in. Needs dlc to be fun.
0;" Very solid city builder. Get the main DLC on sale, it helps alot."
0; so good having some troubles though
0; great city builder that will suck your time right up.
0;" Glistening, glimmering, atmospheric horror, genre redefining, paragon shifting gem"
0; GREAT GAME SHOULD GET
1; Spent hours playing this game specially with improvement mods and after the update there was pretty much almost nothing i could do with it all my saves were incompatible with the new update. I kindly ask please fix this asap.
0;" pretty good game, the AI can be a little bit stupid sometimes but im pretty sure the devs will fix the dumb ai in the sequel"
0; I once played it for 12 hour straight and it felt like 30 minutes.
0;" Been playing this since this game came out. And as another reviewer stated ""This is far and away better than Sim City"", I whole heartedly agree.However, charging us for every DLC that has game improvements is horse manure. On top of that, all the mods are broken, as well as missing chunks of player made content, that I paid for.Paradox obviously doesn't respect the modding community, nore it's player base.Truth be told I wont be buying any Paradox games in the future for this and because pulled the same crude behavior with Stellaris."
0; Sometimes I'd play from dawn to dusk trying to solve traffic jams.
0; Absolutely YES!! This game is amazing and the best city builder currently out there (until CS2 comes out). The only issue is that this game will make you spend more time than you expected XD.
1; It's a fun game when it works. I have a lot of issues with the policy menu that rarely works when I try to open it. I need multiple game reload to eventually have access to it. Also the game will crash when reloading plus sometimes the roads don't properly load in. Those are the only technical issues I have with this game and ya when it manages to work properly I do enjoy playing it a lot.
0; amazing
0; Its a very good game I would suggest Buying the natural Disaster Pack
1; Game doesn't work anymore. Needs some launcher that ends the installation with some error. So i can't play
0; I am adding my update review and video . Review is mostly unedited (though shortened) for posterity.
0; It's pretty good but cause it's paradox there's a million DLC's theres a new game coming out oson
0; best citybuilder for now
0;" Brilliant Fantastic Game, at least 3/4 of the DLC are solid too."
0;" Bes city builder with great graphics, wud recoommend to everyone"
0; i am the one who builds
0; A well developed game taking strategy and management in city building to a new level. The various DLC add depth to the game.
0; What an awesome city builder. I've only played the base vanilla game so far and have had a great time. Will certainly be picking up CS2 this October.
0; great game. great community.
0; Amazing breath of fresh air after EA dropped the ball (and basically destroyed the studio Maxis) with Simcity 2013. LOVE CITIES SKYLINES!!!
0; I used to love this game but the DLC policy is getting ridiculous.
0;" Yes i would highly recommend this to other players, it is a great and free game with lots to explore and do. Dont forget that october this year Cities Skylines 2 is due to realise."
0; Therapeutic
0;" Although looking at some of the DLCs gives me minor brain damage at times, this game is pretty good and gets very addictive once you know what to do. Also with the added Workshop community makes it all the more worth playing, as the modding community are really creative at making the game seem more realistic and that alone makes it worth the money. Hopefully Cities Skylines 2 will be able to top this when it is fully released."
2;" At first I really enjoyed this game. Building a city is a lot of fun, the game mechanics and handling are done in a nice way, and purely through experience you get a better city builder. But, after finishing your first city there's only one challenge left. Do better than your first time. And that's where the game is off.Every single attempt to do better ends up at the same problem: the game does not allow you to forbid left (or right) turns. No matter how smart you design your road system, in the end you always end up with a junction that causes traffic jams that would have been avoidable by a simple ""forbidden to turn left"". The famous Traffic Manager mod enables you to prevent the left turn, but unfortunately does not prevent cars on the opposite side of the road to anticipate on cars crossing the road, still resulting in traffic jams. As soon as you realize that you cannot optimize your traffic, the fun is gone.Once I realized that the standard intersections are quite sub optimal, I gave the asset editor a try. Although creating new intersections is a lot of fun, I got quite irritated by the fact that every intersection you create cannot be placed in your city. It all ends up with a ""slope too steep"" block (even when making everything as flat as the country I live in). To my opinion, this has been done quite amateurish.Altogether I see a lot of potential for being a great game, but I really do not understand why such obvious issues were not tackled by the creators. Let's hope City Skylines II does a better job."
0; Be very very careful. Hours turn to minutes when playing this game.
0; Great game. Just beautiful.Too many DLCs but hey isn't getting paid the point of anything nowadays
0; the poopcano is filling as we speak
0; so good omg
0;" Without Mods: Traffic Simulator Advanced.With Mods: Bob Ross simulator, except with more buildings, and in 3D."
0;" Loving the networks of different things that all work together for a city. A thing i think about while playing is wondering if the trees and parks can add and additional points to fight against pollution, noise or in fighting Co2."
2; please add sex
0;" Its a nice game, but the price is way to high, like 20 Euro would be ok but not 30. Also soo much stuff is locked behind DLC's that you have to pay 400 Euro for to get them all. I'd wait until the release of Cities: Skylines 2 and look if it doesnt lock everything behind DLC's."
0; This game is very fun and has a lot of detail.
0;" My first city went bankrupt, the second was washed away by flood (don't ask), third drowned in sewage, my fourth and current city (as of this writing) is doing fine but city layout is horrible - traffic jams everywhere."
0; i am trash at this game but its pretty good.
0; mending outlast trials
0; all my citizens died because i made them eat dead corpses.
0; my cities is filled with crap and people are doing meth. 10/10 would suffer again
0;" I've always liked simulation games and I grew up playing games like SimCity and Transport Tycoon as a kid.So this game really hit the spot between those two. With endless possibilities, replay value is super high as long as you stay entertained by creating cities. Would recommend if these types of games are your thing."
0; I found it to be very engaging and challenging. I love the idea fo buidling a city.
0; Best city builder there is
0;" I have 215+ hours in the game, but Today marks the day they forced an ""out of game"" launcher on Cities: Skylines. Their reasoning? To sell us more stuff in the future by collecting our data and pushing marketing down our throats and by forcing it in our faces before we even get into the game. This update broke all my save files, all my mods and additional themes, etc. I had a city that i spent 9 hours on and its now gone..."
0; Fun but DLC $$$$
0; better than any other city building game and when I'm making this I've already played for 34 hours and I've only had this for like 3 weeks!
1;" Im Having a problem with the traffic lights. I Put traffic lights down but no traffic lights we're seen. Traffic still stopped at the light but i see no traffic lights. If anybody knows the problem, please let me know."
0; The modern SimCity that we deserve!
0; good. just good what i suposed to say its good.
0; fun and helped me repair the hole in my wall from playing fifa
0; this game perfectly suits raging sociopaths and people who enjoy building complex cities and planning things strategically. I am both.
0;" If you want the best traffic jam simulator out there, or a great way to simulate the physics of a poop volcano, or even navigate to the pains of your simualted and pixelated citizen as you place three stadiums surronding that citizen, then this game is for you.It's not perfect, yeah, but it is leagues ahead."
0; I just dont understand why you have to spend 230$ for things that should already be in the game for free.
0; Road simulator. Living Hell. Don't play unless you want to study angles for the rest of your life.
0; You will spend way too many hours playing this
0; I've committed war-crimes in this game. 10/10
2;" STOP ADDING YOUR LAUNCHER TO GAMES ON STEAM! If I buy your game on Steam, I don't want to buy a shortcut to your launcher just to launch the damn game. The same thing happened to Kerbal Space Program too, quit it."
0; just good but dlc are a bit pricy
0; Best city builder game of all time!
0;" very fun city sandbox building game, if your going to get it i recemend you to buy a pack with some of the DLCs though"
0;" The game captivates players with a realistic city planning experience. Its detailed graphics and complex gameplay make the process of building a city highly satisfying.There is not enough guidance for new players at the beginning of the game., which can make it confusing for newcomers.Moreover, the fact that some essential features are offered in expansion packs is also a point of criticism. For those who want to play the game, they should know in advance that they will feel the need for DLC packs to fully experience the game. Players who enjoy city-building games will be thoroughly satisfied with this game when played with all DLC packs. Either they should play the game with all DLCs or not play it at all."
0;" Very happy, thank you Colossal for doing what EA couldn't."
0;" I really enjoy playing this game as a sandbox city builder. Mods also make it a great experience, like digital gardening."
0; I like the game but... almost 400 quids worth of DLCs? Rly?
0; good for my autism
2; This is the best city builder game I have ever played. I like how many options there are to build the city of your dreams. The one thing I would like to add is an easy way to build a neighborhood and save it and copy it to my map. I'm sure there is a way to do this but I don't know how and I wish it was easy to do. I'm a newbie and it is a lot of fun. Thank you developers and programmers. I love this game.
0; Best citiybuilder fr fr
0; fav game
0; roads.
0; One of my favorite games of all time. The modding community helps big time tho main game features arent so bad too. You can cause floods and pollute your city.
2; this game just dosent stop having DLC's for once
0;" I bought the base game, because that should be the experience they expected customers to pay full price for upon initial release.This is such a bad bad bad AND SAD excuse for an upgraded SimCity. User interface, graphics, excitement, expansion are ALL nearly non-existant in the base game. You get a handful of maps, you HAVE TO build exactly as directed, there is no freedom of gameplay. Everything is locked until you ""progress"" as if your playing an RPG. There's no ""management"", no ""city builder"" it's all scripted.Worst City Sim I've ever purchased."
0; i can not fine eney good stuf
0;" fun, but clunky sometimes and i think makes the same mistakes most city builders make, including--police are required and ""prevent crime"" (not housing, transport, wages, and healthcare like every study has found)--educated people = better--only big cities need/can have buses (they only unlock after 1800+)--integrated communities don't work? all industry pollutes the land here, so letting people live near work = sickness, which then reinforces the city's need for roads and extensive cars/transport/traffic.the game allowed me to manually unlock buses, but the education, pollution, and police mechanics are locked in as far as I can tell. it's fun building a city but I wish I could work with the industry buildings to research less pollution and safer practices - I want to build walkable communities with tons of work, healthcare, and housing you know?anyway, it's fun, but it was a little heartbreaking/tone deaf/not what modern cities need to look like sometimes."
0;" After years of owning this game and somewhat enjoying it, this game changed it's privacy policy which I'm sure not many will read or care. However, I am seeing this more and more in games where they will force you to accept their policy of collecting your information including certain private information otherwise you won't be able to play the game. What happened? I don't want to have my private information and data tracked and used with third parties just to play this game. I'm sad that they decided to do this now."
0;" Once you start on Cities Skylines, say a heartfelt farewell to your free time. Loved SimCity 4? Buy this. You won't regret it.This game has two sides.Out of the box it is a fun, but somewhat repetitive after 100 hours, city simulation game. It'll still take up months of your time, but eventually all your cities will look the same.The mods is where the game truly becomes a masterpiece. Once you get the right mods, it truly becomes a giant sandbox. You'll be able to do everything from combine buildings to creating parks to the tiniest details, to combining thousands of props to create your own buildings from scratch right inside the game. Take a stroll around the city, hop on a bus... You can dream it, you can probably do it.Pro's:- Various play styles. The developers included mods to enable Sandbox mode and Hard Mode, so you can choose how you wish to play. Want to play without money first, then turn money back on? Sure, just turn off the Unlimited Money mod!- MODS. No, seriously, the mods make this game what it is. Between Move It, Plop The Growables, RICO, More Beautification, Anarchy mods and TMPE, this becomes a completely different game. You can do pretty much anything.- Assets. The workshop is full of extraordinary assets, and it grows larger every day.- The community is amazing.Con's:- The game is build on the Unity Engine. This engine was not meant for simulation games, especially of this size. It doesn't support lazy loading, meaning all 81 tiles are all loaded and rendered at all time, and all assets (vanilla and custom) are loaded into the RAM for the entire duration of the game, whether you use them or not. As such you'll need a decent amount of RAM and a decent CPU to run the game.- Traffic takes some thinking. Cims are abysmal drivers, and so just slapping down a few roads is not enough. You'll have to start learning a bit about how traffic works. There are Traffic AI mods that improve things, but they are quite CPU heavy.Yes if:- You're looking for a sandbox city builder where you can build whatever city you like. Grab a few mods and it becomes a virtual sandbox for you to play around in.- You want a sequel to SimCity 4.No if:- You're looking for an in-depth socio-economic, demographic city management game. There is no political system.- You own a system with an IntelHD GPU. Just don't, it clearly says it's incompatible. Stop complaining the game doesn't work."
1;" After 30 mins of trying to solve various issues, I discovered that I cannot fix them because the game isn't compatible with mac OS. The issues were that the mouse is out of alignment and the text is extremely blurry, making the game unplayable."
0;" The best and the most addictive city builder to date, the hours played speaks alot. Big shoutout to the modders community as well! Defo 11/10 highly recommend and will probably adding more hours here even when the next installment released. Cheers to the next thousands of hours to come!"
1;" So damned buggy. I used to be able to play this game, with downloaded assets and mods with no problems. The last year or so, updates have wiped out some of the mods I've used and it's become uplayable. Even with loading mods one at a time the program balks, stops, or just closes down. I'm done."
0; I like to roleplay as american presidents and neglect my civic responsibilities of making sure my people do not die. My favorite Way to neglect them is Pollute their air like they live in Shijiazhuang China Great Game Highly Recommend
0; feeding my addiction for public transport is not a good thing
0; I built a city and it flooded.I rebuilt the city and it burnt down.
0;" Not much to say about it now that Cities 2 is coming out. I really love this game. And most issues I have with it, is going to be fixed in Cities 2. I think even after Cities 2 comes out, this game will stay around for a long while, due to the incredible modding library."
0;" Very good, high quality game. You have to really use your brain sometimes, unlike in some other games. Only bad thing about this game is that it is rather addictive"
0; really need good public transportation in my hometown
0; Pretty much entertaining game
0; Best Game Ever
0; it is an all around great game and i don't find much wrong with it
0; Bad but good game. I think that sums it up quite well
0; very good wld recommend
0; Good game but way to many dlc that is a paradox special though
1; I can't click on anything once the legal agreement pops up
0;" One of the best games I've ever played. You can get really creative with how you build your cities and the game lets you have a pretty good range of freedom. It actually wasn't even until the trailer for CS II came out that I realized that we really needed a remake, so I'd suggest waiting to see how that is before you purchase either game."
0; This game is amazing!
1; Great Game to pass the time besides the occasional bugs which can sometimes be game breaking i find myself coming back to this title again and again.
0; i know im gonna get a ton of hate off of this but you need a dlc for everything so yeah i dont like this game at all
0;" I make the people drink their own wastage lmao. Susan keeps ♥♥♥♥ talking me on Cities Twitter, this is why she lives next to the tip."
0;" Very engaging and a ton of stuff to do. I love how involved I can get in the details when I have time, but that I don't have to if I just want to build for a day."
2;" I need multiplayer mode. I hope to developer build Multiplayer mode please….we can share our power, water supply etc and I can export my product to other player request. Built the cities together and if disaster we can help other player cities to send our Disaster response unit to them."
0;" This game captured my imagination and creativity,it is the best city builder games I have ever played, bring on CS2 !!."
0; I enjoy the game!
0; Me when the council gets me down
0; Its great and yeah
0; they should recycle more
0;" it was good, then they did something with all the moeds so they werent compatibale, so thats the big minus, otherwise it good, and i think that all the mods you have bought should be transfered to Cities skyline but sense its paradox it wont happened because they are money crazy"
0;" After 8 years of playing Cities Skylines... I think I'm getting the hang of building and running a city.Would definitely recommend getting it along with the DLC & CCP packs especially as they add new features to the game, on top of all this you have the workshop with hundreds of thousands of assets and mods to download and enhance your gameplay."
0; build a supercomputer
0; A women complained about my city and i threw a meteor at her home
0;" Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines!Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it!Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :DDo I recommend this game? :D Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm."
0; i figured out how to build a dam
0; This game is a lot of fun and is so close to being an accurate to life sim that it is used by civil engineers to practice design ideas.
0;" A fantastic City builder that unfortunately has a black mark of insane amounts of DLC, trying to play without it feels like i'm missing out on so much but getting all of it would be way to expensive. I sincerely hope CS:2 does not become laden with the same issue of every cool new thing having to be a DLC."
0;" Just love creating cities. Endless possibilities through DLC, mods etc"
0;" Great game, great community. Doesn't get any better. Or, maybe it does... in October 2023"
0;" If you liked SimCity, this is it's spiritual successor."
0; Absolutely fun if you like the feeling of accomplishing something
0; This is absolutly fire game. you have many options how to play and can build your metropole like you want. i 100% reccomend this game but only 1 big thing i dont like about this game is the fact that it has so many dlc like all paradox games which makes me thing im missing out so many thing but i dont wnat to spend so much money on a dlcs to a game
0;" Good city game, Very hard tough"
0; Fun to play (mostly) and more immersive and realistic than other zombie games.
0; better than SimCity
0;" much game, many wow"
0; i love how realilistic it is
0;" Very fun and relaxing game, you should play this if you dislike the casual side of games like Clash of Clans and really just want to build a big, prosperous city"
0; this game is made for autistics who sit like shrimp at their computers for 12 hours at a time.
0; Outstanding game. Definitely scratches that Sim City itch.
0;" I made a dam to generate hydroelectric power, my entire city flooded and since i spent so much money on the dam not even the bailout saved me and i went bankrupt. 11/10 would drown my people again."
0;" Cities: Skylines does not disappoint! I was a huge fan of the original SimCity games (Classic through to SimCity 4), and Cites: Skylines was a modernized version of everything that made SImCity great. I only complaint is that traffic management can sometimes be difficult and time-consuming, but that is true to life."
0; It is a game that you can easily get addicted to. I have spent many hours playing on PC and console and I wanna build more and more
0;" To keep it short, the game is amazing but I can't really recommend it or the sequel once that game comes out simply because they've had the audacity to continue to release paid DLC when the sequel's release date is pretty much right around the corner. If you don't have this game wait for the sequel to come out and decide for yourself if buying the new game is worth it, especially since it will inevitably have at least 10 paid DLCs each costing about 10-20 USD or if the first game is better either overall or at the very least for your preference based on what the new one offers plus it's DLC.Paradox, I love your games, I f-ing despise your business model."
0; Great game! You can create your heart's content and watch your city grow
0; Very rewarding game to learn with tons of room for creativity
0; fire city building even more fire wit the workshop community and mods
0;" Good game, much happy"
2; okok not bad but I want polluted waste cleaner in normal game pls
0; Comfort game.
0; it was good
0;" This is an amazing game! Probably the biggest issues is that you need mods to make your cities look pretty good. I have a ton of mods installed, and there are several I won't play without. You'll probably experiencing a lot of pain playing vanilla, especially if you like your cities to look perfect.But once you get those mods, this game is a ton of fun. Can't wait for Cities Skylines 2. If you like building things, this game is for you!"
0;" The game is entirely held up by mods but the devs do everything they can to break every mod with every update. Incredibly frustrating. The game has not withstood the test of time, it's just standing up off of mods at the moment."
0;" With all that traffic, it's like living in LA 10/10. Roundabouts ftw!!!!"
0; i liked the part where the bomb goes off
0;" Upon download it installed an unwelcome extra app called Paradox without warning or permission.Do not download this game if you don't want a sketchy extra launcher to slog your machine and steal your info.0/10 - Not cool guys, not cool at all."
0; Very fun and addictave
0; how do city designers do this irl this is so difficult
1; I bought the game and then it disabpeared from my librayer
1;" Game is broken since update. If I click on a airport asset, I get an error: Object reference not set to an instance of an object [System.NullReferenceException] Details: No details. I've uninstalled the game, unsubscribed from all assets and mods, started a new game. Same error. The game is broken and unfortunately I cannot recommend a broken game."
0; It is a lot of fun but can be challenging at the very start.
0; i haven't showered in weeks
0; VISIT SPRINGWOOD NJ TODAY!
0; Spend 8 hours to get bottle-necked in between a rock and a hard place. Garbage game. Don't even buy it on sale.
0; get game to play high af
0; I like the game mabye gonna buy it later again but I did a refund bc I didn’t found good mods yet and I have transport fever 2 sort of the same but yeah I like the game when I see it on YouTube
0; Good game sometimes annoying for the road builder
0;" Entertaining, yet a little complicated at first but worth the try."
1; do not BUY i cant get a refund besuce the game keeps crashing and its not mods dont download i got scamed of like 50 bucks and it wont run
0; its quite relaxing when you arent losing money
0; The game for moody people
0; Such a good game for sure.
0; I never get bored of this game
0;" Cities: Skylines - A City-Building Triumph with Expansive PotentialCities: Skylines, developed by Colossal Order, is a city-building simulation game that offers an immersive and expansive experience for players to craft and manage their own urban landscapes. With its depth, attention to detail, and creative possibilities, Cities: Skylines has become a beloved title among fans of the genre. However, it's worth noting the abundance of paid DLC and the upcoming sequel that may impact the game's future.Cities: Skylines provides a robust foundation for city-building enthusiasts. The game offers a wealth of tools and features, allowing players to shape their cities with intricate road networks, zoning districts, and a wide variety of buildings and landmarks. The level of customization and control over every aspect of urban planning is commendable, creating a sense of ownership and accomplishment as your city flourishes under your guidance.One aspect that may divide players is the extensive offering of paid DLC. While the base game provides a solid experience, it's hard to ignore the significant number of additional content packs that come at an extra cost. These DLCs introduce new gameplay elements, such as additional buildings, scenarios, and cosmetic enhancements, expanding the possibilities for city creation. However, the reliance on paid content can be seen as a drawback for players who prefer a more inclusive experience without the need for additional purchases.Despite the presence of paid DLC, Cities: Skylines has maintained a dedicated and active modding community. The game's openness to user-generated content has resulted in a vast library of player-created mods, which range from minor tweaks to substantial additions that enhance the gameplay experience. The modding support allows players to customize their cities even further and add new features, effectively extending the game's lifespan and replayability.In terms of visuals and audio, Cities: Skylines presents a charming and immersive experience. The game's graphics are visually appealing, with vibrant colors, detailed buildings, and lively animations that bring the city to life. The accompanying soundtrack adds to the ambiance, providing a soothing and melodic backdrop as you shape your urban masterpiece.In conclusion, Cities: Skylines is a remarkable city-building simulation game that allows players to unleash their creativity and administrative skills. While the abundance of paid DLC may be a concern for some, the game's solid foundation, extensive modding support, and the anticipation for its potential sequel ensure that Cities: Skylines will continue to captivate players who yearn for a deeply immersive city-building experience."
0; I can make my own worlds and the community brings everlasting additional content and functionality. All good.
0;" This game is pretty good, sad to see the dlc is to expensive tho"
0;" i playing gam my coal power plant ran out of coal so my city go out of power so everyone abandon the city and i go to -$300,000. gam want me to tak bailout for $50,000 so i only -$250,000 but i no take and then i use power of tax to get bak to +$$$. gud gam"
0;" Although confusing for beginners, once you understand the main goal of the game Its a blast"
1; Been trying to play this game for months and I used to play it almost everyday since I purchased it in 2016. The game updated one day back in January and ever since I haven't been able to play it. I've tried all the methods that were recommended from deleting apache folders to the command file to bypass launcher and still no luck and I've become extremely frustrated about it because I really loved playing this game on a regular.
0; a bit confusing at first but super fun once everything is understood.
0;" I really like this game. To me it seems basic and rightly so. All games have their own foot print, so to say. They are all unique in their own way. Cities is no different. I have played another game similar to this and it has its own set of things to do, such as mine for ore, dig for oil, etc. and enjoyed it thoroughly as do I this one. This version is a good starter to get to know it. Version 2 looks to be a winner. So if you enjoy these games then this is a good starter for what is next, and next really looks good. Its free to download, so do it and enjoy."
0; A really cool game. Can literally spend hours on end playing it.
2;" This game died when it hit 50 DLCs. C'mon Paradox, most of these should be free content drops with how little are in some of these $5 packages."
0; ABSELOUTELY GREAT GAME ITS VERY ADDICTIVE BUT FUN
0;" If you loved Cim Sity, yadda yadda"
0; I downloaded this game then...............I played it for 20 hours straight.110% recommend.
0; Feels a bit slow at times but fun
0;" Terrible game, don't buy it. You'll never enjoy it."
0;" I love city building games. I played the demo for cities skylines ages ago and it get kinda soulless to me, so naturally i went back to SC4. However, it was on sale, i picked it up. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I've missed out on so much and now with CS2 about to come out my only regret is not being able to experience this game sooner."
0;" Very fun to build and explore different ways of making a city. I like that some features unlock as you build the city so you're not overwhelmed at the beginning. I do wish there was a more involved tutorial like an example city to show you the ropes and then you go on to whatever scenario you want. Overall, I do love this game!"
0; its good if you know how to play the game
0; This game fulfilled my dream of creating the perfect city full of intersections and minimal living space.
0;" Great game for all ages, the community is great. Lots of ways you can customise your city."
0; Good idea bad execution
1; it doesn't launch
0; this game is so cool. thwe 12 better be the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!
0; This game made me start to realize how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the places I live are planned and how horrid it is for traffic flow. Highly reccomend
0;" A meteor dropped on my city, Fantastic game, makes me experience my future dreams."
2;" Quality of game is good. Price is bad. DLC costs are absurd, unimpressive. Most of the core game functions should have been released in Patches, not DLC. Paradox as usual."
0;" This game's just awesome. It's so satisfying to watch your city grow. All the DLCs are a bit much, but they aren't necessary. The game is just fine on vanilla, and everything on the workshop built by the awesome community will make it so that you never get bored. It's worth it's price, and worth your time."
0; I'm literally addicted to this game
0; what can i say try it out for your self is you liked sim city or like the sims or think what if i had my own island how would you run it ?
1; Game wont open when i launch it. I've tried everything and even messaged support don't buy. Cant even get a refund even though it does not work. I have been scammed by this game.
0; this game is the best and i would never delete it
0; Good game good experiance
0;" There is several glitches exist in this new update, please fix. Here is going to include1. Vehicle will be auto despawn at certain road when the road just upgraded ( auto despawn was off).2. Landscaping was extremely lag and the fps will suddenly drop a lot.3. Vehicles that drive on a new road(not updated road) will suddenly lessen its speed to around 10 kmh ( it’s pretty annoying to fix it with tmpe).4. Floating trucks that are returning to their facilities.Ngl these things has ruined my industry network and gaming experiences, pls fix as soon as possible thanks."
0;" Hey EA, look at how much fun I'm having not playing your games!"
0; started playing this game at 23:00 10 minutes later it was 4:00 this game made me time travel
0; city gaem and people with cars and roads!!!1!!!
0; The best city builder ever.
0; A really good game but when you play it I recomend buying dlc for example mass transit or indrusties and also insling mods like 81 titles or trafic president
0; fun
1; The service vehicles spawning bug is still not fixed after ... many years and updates. This developer does not deserve a single customer.
0;" this game so much fun but stressfull too, overall this game is fine. can't wait for CS2!"
1; after last update games will not load unless u follow a 10 step fix the involves deleting a window 11 app that some of us need to work from home.maybe version 2 they will figured out how to programgood job steam!!
0;" Despite it's flaws, it's easily the best city builder out there. Period."
0; Addicted.
1; The game crashes and doesnt even show the mod list in the game to disable incompatible mods after the update. I recommend throwing your time in the WC rather than in this game.
0;" i really wish that the game could incorporate multiple other cities , which you can connect together similar to ""simcity""i would be so damn interesting just imagine it . the game would be whole"
0; the plumber said i put the police station too close to the childrens hospital
0; Post of my hours of city skylines has been using cheats. hence barely any achievements however I adore this game. I can play with game all day long. I also can get frustrated with it at the same time.
0; The game is just generally fun.
0; This game is brilliant! i would recommend the traffic mod because it is also really good
0; This Game is Kinda Funny.
0; 100k citizens make ur pc go brrrrrrrgood soup
0; Somehow made the inner workings of city design interesting to me lol
0; its an amzing game
1;" Many bugs and glitches that can just corrupt your save at any time regardless of weather you have mods or not,"
0; Definitely currently the best city builder game I've played. Especially when you add mods that add to the experience rather than break the game. Could use improvement on Traffic AI though.
0; why is there poop in da water
0; It's fine
0; This is probably the best city builder ever made though if your considering buying it now i would wait for its sequel which comes in December i think
0;" I am losing my sanity to this game since I love it so much. It scratches an itch as a creative yet analytical person.Best with mods and 10,000+ assets."
0; Great Game. Love building my own city.
0; So addicting! I always end up playing way longer than intended
0; Great game. Can't wait for CS2
0;" best game ever, hope the second is as good or better!"
0; massive mohammed
2; I couldn't get on with it. Too difficult to get started after playing over 7 hours with a max of 15 minutes per game before I had to restart. It need an easy mode for new players to get started and gain some experience. Also the rotate and angle key controls dont work well and would be better to be hotkey mapped to the mouse (if they are I couldn't find it).
0;" Cities Skylines is a good city builder game where you have to keep a good economy solve problems going on in the city and build/expand. Don't worry about reviews saying its only fun with DLCs and mods because if your not a serious player and you just want to build a good, big city you don't need the DLCs that will give you a few extra buidlings that you won't even notice. I only use mods when theres something in game that I want to change but other than that I don't see any need for them if you just want to build a functioning city.I bought this game a few months back but now I would just wait until Cities Skylines 2 drops because it will be a better version of the game and will be releasing in a few months."
0;" Become a traffic snob. Bore your friends about infrastructure design. Highjack local authority meetings with your informed opinion about road layouts.This game is a time vampire. Once purchased, many hours of your life will be spent building the perfect roundabout, locating industrial zones and trying to make residential areas rich.This is your opportunity to be god, or the next best thing, a local authority member."
0; Tiananmen Square simulator but the protest is for garbage build and water contamination
0; it is a good city builder
0; i love this game
0;" The base game is fairly ok, but it needs mods to really shine. Performance wise it's quite CPU intensive, and the more workshop assets you enable, the worse the lag will get, and as such it's in dire need of a good refactoring. I think the company will likely scratch it and make cities:skylines 2 rather than investing a ton of resources on this game's likely bloated codebase.The bottom line is that you need a high-end computer, and a good number of mods and workshop assets.You may also want a few DLCs which add a lot of additional gameplay options. IMHO these ""priority"" DLCs are:* After dark* Sunset harbor* Industries* Park Life* Mass TransitThere are also some content-creator packs which (ironically) are much cooler (and useful) than paradox-made DLCs. For example, the content creator pack ""Train Stations"" gives you more options to create efficient and gorgeous train and metro hubs by adding train stations with 4 platforms and metro hubs which can handle 5 different lines"
0;" Solid and reliable game, which has loads of downloadable contemt amd an active modding community. Many hours of playing uf you get into it."
1;" cursor stuttering, and sometimes the steering wheel frozen while the game still run smoothly in 100fps"
0; This game is the best of it's time (Until the sequel comes out)!
2; Fun time waster. Makes you think and plot. Wish it were multi-player
0; The game still holds up today but is starting to show its age. Highly recommend using Mods at this late stage in the game's life cycle.
0; Traffic Simulator with a dash of city building.
0; i like mods
0; Really fun even if I am not the best at the game. DLC's are a must have I've noticed as they give you so many more options to work with. Mass transit is a heavy recommend in my opinion.
0;" this game gives me a will to live. the will of live. the reason why my wife still loves me, and my kids haven't left me. alone, in a room, a rubber room, filed with rats, rats make me crazy. crazy?"
0; This stuff is well good
0; I love this game and it does not cost much money.Ill want cityskylines 2
0; The game is not launching via Steam.
0; Build a city until traffic flow reaches 25% then start a new city. 10/10
0; The best city builder ever
0;" amazing, fun, addictive"
0;" You should prbly get a few dlc's along with this, but it is a great game. Extensive Steam workshop and mod base. You also could wait for C:S 2 to come out."
1; Unplayable. My city wont get water or power. I have like 2 water treatment plants and 4 power turbine thingys.
0; you'll be sucked in if you love city building games. Will say all the good stuff is DLC.
0;" Complicated, but a few youtube tutorials should help you learn all the mechanics fairly quickly."
0; this is so fun I am playing all day eery day
1;" this is a great game. Lots of epic content, but the reason I'm saying no is because after days of working on this game, it deleted all of my progress. I saved the game, multiple times. Maybe 12 times a day. Yet when i opened the game my save wasnt there. It deleted everything I had worked on. The devs of this game NEED to fix this"
0; ver 2 will release soon.
1; game got crashed many time bad game
2; best city build game and i hope Cities Skylines II have more functions
0;" With Cities Skylines 2 on the horizon, I will never play this game again. I will say simply though, that Colossal Order is in tune with the community, and this game flourished as a result. CS 2015 sucked, CS 2023 is phenomenal."
0; good very good
0;" Some mods are necessary to enjoy the game, but it is very few, TP:ME is pretty much the only one that is mandatory, as is move it! Other than that you're ready and able to go. MOST DLC goes on sale regularly, industry is probably the best and others are preference. Give it a try when it is on sale. DO NOT go crazy adding mods and add as few assets as needed otherwise your game will use an insane amount of system ram."
0; BEST GAME EVER!
0; Lots of fun.
1;" I keep getting an error every time I press the airport module and its kinda sad. Its something about an object error or something. Basically, I click airport, my mouse leaves the module and goes back onto the map and I get an error that I can not reverse. I have to force quit the game with task manager to restart it. Besides that its a pretty good game."
0;" This game refuses to hold my hand, as it should. Played for 12 hours straight - reluctant to leave my computer to shower, eat and go to the bathroom. Basic needs are for losers."
2;" I can't deal with this game... There's too many frustrating, horribly designed elements... like building themes and styles. Just make it easier to change the building themes please."
2;" Fun, pls add official Steam Deck support at least for C:S 2"
0; How to use 10000+ people as your labrats
0; Amazing game but u loose track of time playing
0;" This is, in my opinion, the best city builder game. The OG game didn't even have the level of detail this game provides."
0; Cities: Skylines 2 > Cities: Skylines with mods > Cities: Skylines with DLCs > Cities: Skylines vanilla > any other game.
0; I can't stop.
0; forced my citizens to eat sewage then they all died horrifically as i watched and laughed
0; Best city builder game
0;" If you liked Sim City, this game is very similar. I have not played a whole lot yet, but from my experience so far, I definitely recommend if you are looking to build a city of your own."
0; autism soother
0;" it's really cool, if you like to solve sity trobles"
0;" Really good game,"
0; You can destroy Manhattan (or any other city you hate) with meteors for the low price of $15 USD.
0;" I love this game, its so fun. ive spent 20+ hours playing this game and im probably gonna spend another 200 because there is so much to do. if you get bored of the main game, theres always mods to make it more interesting or challenging."
0; Runescape has better AI pathfinding than this
0; I feel like Vizzy T building my little city.
0; Best game ever.
0; wasted way to many hours in this game.I wish it wasn't that fun to play.
0;" There is a bit of a learning curve if you want to make realistic working cities, but after watching a few YouTube videos and playing around a bit you get a hang of it. Tho be careful cause you can lose track of time. I would load up a save at 8pm and then look at the clock and its already 12 or 1am."
0; I like raining meteor showers on my citizens daily. Really keeps them on the move.
0; its fun
0;" Game is really fun, Super great time killer. Would recommend to someone who is needing a game to play and is sick of all the battle royals."
1;" cant even load the map. keep crashing on the loading screen. i follow all the suggestion on the internet, but none of them works."
0;" So fun, reminds me of the good old days of sim city 2000."
0; so i liked it on my last steam account but lost that account... But right now i cant afford it..
0;" This game is the best city building game out there. I've always wanted to make and run my own city, and this game helped me achieve this goal. I recommend playing this game because of the gameplay and graphics. I'm so grateful that the base game comes with so. Much. Stuff! Good thing there isn't a ""Garbage Expansion Pack"" or ""Healthcare Expansion Pack"" I don't own any expansion packs, but the game is still addicting and awesome."
0; The best city-builder currently on the market!
0; its just perfect for people who want to shape a world (or city) in their own image
0; Soooo good.
0;" I got this game on my Xbox years ago and I got it again on steam and it still is an awesome game, a million times better than the sim city and with cities skylines II coming out soon I will be buying it"
0; A lot to do
0; i like beacuse it is so educational for president
0; you make city
0;" pretty cool game, not very good at it but is very enjoyable"
0; A city game thats not a dissapointment The workshop has diffrent buildings that look super cool and can fit in some type of city anyways in conclusion this city game is a total classic
0; I would recommend this game.
0;" Alright game but all the actually fun stuff is locked behind DLCs. This would be alright if there were only 3 to 4 DLCs but there are 62 and they aren't very cheap, as to buy all the DLCs costs just shy of $400. That is ridiculous and paradox interactive's headquarters should be burnt down."
0; This is the best city builder out there! So excited for the 2nd game.
0;" Build a beautiful city, then proceed to demolish then demolish all exits from said city and the waste water system, watch as your citizens bathe in their own filth until death, For added amusement try flooding your city"
0; yes :D
0;" I unironically spent like 2 hours min-maxing the traffic lanes for my roundabouts, only to unlock buses and reduce traffic in my city by like half."
0;" Most detailed city sim ever , traffic AI can be better but overall an amazing game"
2; on the next one please put an actual tutorial
0;" I really recommend this game if you love the creativity of customizing a city. Sadly, without the DLCs, the game is kind of bland so I do recommend finding a guide on the best DLCs to buy/find. Just make sure not to have too many because some computers can't handle too many DLCs. Though at this point, I recommend waiting for Cities Skylines 2."
0; W game
0; with all the mods i use im lucky if the game loads after 40 mins 👍10/10 best simcity killer
0; Love this game
0; bought the gamecovered my town is ♥♥♥♥went home to play city skylines
0; The game is good
0; Built a town next to a river. Said town started to overflow with sewage and kill off half my population. It's a great game.
0; it is good and fun :D
0;" If you liked SimCity decades ago, you'll like this and absolutely LOVE Cities Skylines II coming out in October."
0; Tis the best city builder until the sequel comes out.
0; I hate traffic IRL. I started to hate it even more when i started to play Cities Skylines. Now i started to walk more often. I still hate traffic.
0; Very good city simulation game. I especially like the complexity of the traffic planning.
0; amazing game good content
0;" Excellent game to waste hours micromanaging and multitasking in, the more you play the more you learn and the better your cities get, addictive, I love it!"
0;" guess im somehwat of a civil engineer myself,,,"
0;" It is a great fun game. Can be challenging. As a beginner it is hard, but you can still have fun. Enjoy the game and good luck!"
0; its a city builder game that you can actually build a city in.
0; i would be a terrible city designer
0; Time Killer.
0; THEY SCREW YOU WITH THEIR DLC
0; Best city builder game ever created.Period.
0; ♥♥♥♥ and balls loves this game so i do to
1; glitchy game that crashes all the time
0;" Fun game if you enjoy city builders. Lots of mods, and not too hard to pick up. Downsides are the price of the DLC, but otherwise a very fun and well put together game. Chances are though if you'd enjoy it, you probably already bought it."
1; Played on my computer with an i7 processor and 32 gigs of ram and it crashed 4 times in 3 hours of gameplay and would not save any of my progress.
0; Very chill until a fat ass meteor hits in the middle of my high residential city. i luv the chaos
0; Awesome simulation and enjoy building a city from the start.
0; Favorite game of all time. Thank you for an amazing 8 years.
0;" Really great game, hours of play time, always new DLCs makes it like a new game each time."
0; what happened to my entire evening simulator
1; After another update the game just does not start when I'm loading one of my saves. Neither does it start when I press NEW GAME button.They (the devs) have just literally RUINED such a beautiful game!
0; Traffic doesn't go brrrrrr
0; epic game in general. would recommend getting DLCs to make the game more interesting
0; One of the greatest games ever made. My only regret is that i suck at designing.
0;" I'm late to the game, so anything I can say has already been said. Great game, much fun."
0; Fantastic. I now know what road hierarchy is and I wish I didn't
0; Really GOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDD....
0; Such an amazing game that I can sit down and somehow find myself playing for hours even though I don't understand how traffic works.
1; Great Game But Unplayable.City skylines is a great game with decent graphics and interesting mechanics however currently after a recent update the cursor has been the wrong height (this isn't just happening to me) which makes the Really unpleasant to play so I would say until the bug is fixed I would not recommend.
2; Its a pretty good game but pls Paradox many of these dlcs should be included in the base game
0; i love cities skylines
0;" After about 27 hours I discovered by chance that you can set/remove traffic lights and stop signs your roads. Upon my word, I felt an incredible thrill. I'm skylines-pilled"
0;" I have started playing this game back in May 2019 and in Oct. 2019 I have played for over 800 hours.This game it self is a basic city builder game. But when you add in all the DLC,Mods and assets, It become a very custom game for you. Now the game engine it self when you get a big Population around 100,000 people in your City the game slows down.You can make Custom map, assets, themes, Mods. Or get them from a very large Community Workshop right here on Steam.Over all I do Highly Recommend this game. I give this game a 8.5 out of 10 Ratting.Now I have been Playing PC games since the late 70's and this game is in my top 5 best game I have played in 40 years since I have been playing games."
0;" Cities: Skylines has a much deeper feeling in terms of design and management of the city compared to other games. My first impression was how immersive it was, every road and every building mattered and they were all interconnected. The vehicles didn't just spawn, citizens were going from A to B, the same as cargo vehicles. I feel myself a real city planner and I care about those cims :)Making transport lines in different colours was something that impressed me the most when I played it for the very first time. It was OCD or perfectionist's paradise for me. Every new DLC was exciting, especially parks and airport dlc, I have never seen something like that before. Industries impreseed me as well with their production chains. And the list goes on.Developers really listened to the community and made the game better and better. Cities I've built were really ALIVE. It taught me so much about urban planning. I'm greateful to everyone involved."
0; Its Realy Good and fun the mods for the game are great!
2;" the game should be renamed from ""euro truck simulator"" to ""a small portion of europe truck simulator"""
0; Im in between first thing the cost right now 10 dollars IS AN AMAZING DEAL but i dont have basic features for some reason like disaters and i find it complicated to install mods idk where to even get them at this point but yes this is the best city builder out here and never will be outplaced until city skylines two
0; city skylines is so relaxing to play. i would recommend it too so many with anxiety because its so calming. 10/10 from me.
0; Top tier game
0;" Great game! New version is coming out soon, so it's good timing to brush up."
0;" On the plus side, after being immersed in the community for this game, I'm now hypercritical of real life city and road design and break down into tears upon seeing poor intersection layouts."
1; Spent hours playing this game specially with improvement mods and after the update there was pretty much almost nothing i could do with it all my saves were incompatible with the new update. I kindly ask please fix this asap.
0;" city skylines is a really nice game. I play it everyday, AMAZING!"
1;" i just download the game but it didn't wrong, they told me to get last update and i don't see any, how can i play the game?i payed 110 for it and i can't play it"
0;" The controls don't make sense. Hard to work. Information about HOW to play is not available. The info-windows tell you the obvious stuff, whereas how to get things done--no information."
0; Best city building game ive played
0; it good game
0; play this game if your bored and be careful of traffic they get cramped up easily
0;" Cities: Skylines is like juggling bulldozers while trying to build a functional city. It's a delightful blend of urban planning and utter chaos. Just when you think you've mastered traffic management, a tornado decides to take a detour through your perfectly laid-out streets. And don't even get me started on the sewage system mishaps that turn your pristine rivers into a chocolate milkshake. The citizens are as quirky as a llama riding a unicycle, with demands for parks and unicorns. But despite the madness, creating your own city is an addictive, laughter-inducing rollercoaster. So grab your hard hat and get ready for urban planning on the edge of insanity!"
0;" This is a solid game, but far from the greatest sandbox game you could get your hands on.It's a city builder. That's what it does. It builds cities.And it does it pretty well, except I could never seem to get Education balanced with business districts and whatnot. It's really annoying, but it doesn't necessarily kill the growth of the city. Every city I made I always got the notification that there are not enough workers, or that they are not educated enough, or that there aren't enough jobs for highly educated people or something. That part of the game sucks, but everything else is great!There are an obscene amount of DLCs for this game, most of which I have ignored but I do have a few.If you have an itch to build a little city, give it water and power, assign districts, watch them grow, and maybe play around with parks, landscaping, bus lines (good luck!), and other things that can kill a lot of time, this game is for you. It's hard to not recommend this game. But, there are a lot of little annoying things that happen when you play that you will just need to deal with, like traffic for instance.There will be one spot in your city that has too much traffic and it will drive you insane every time.Still, it's a good game. Does what it says on the tin and whatnot. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it unless you get lots of the DLCs for some reason, but it is what it is. A solid B+."
0; lets pray that the second game doesn't have over 200 dollars of DLC's
1;" Doesn't work on 14 inch macbook pro, the mouse cursor is offset, and therefore the game is unplayable. When played windowed there are no resolutions available that fit the display completely, and some parts are cutoff. Generally a problem with the engine, would be fixed if only there was a windowed option that is smaller than 1920*1170 in order to fit on the display when it is on a notched mac. Maybe something that just checks the resolution of the display?"
0; I loved SimCity as a kid an this game is such an upgrade to that. Gives me a sense of nostalgia.
1;" Game is broken since update. If I click on a airport asset, I get an error: Object reference not set to an instance of an object [System.NullReferenceException] Details: No details..I've uninstalled the game, unsubscribed from all assets and mods, started a new game. Same error. The game is broken and unfortunately I cannot recommend a broken game."
1; The game always crashes at the loading screen when loading a new game or city.
0; Such a fun game feels like playing with virtual lego
0; Best city builder ever.
0;" Cities Skylines is a great game don't get me wrong. I would say it's the best city building game of Steam I'm aware of apart from maybe the Anno franchise.I question though the rapid push of new DLCs trying to get the last dimes of their customers just before the release of their sequel.To be honest, the game was already completely fine in terms of complexity what feels like 10 DLCs ago.Selling under the tag ""Content Creator Pack"" what is basically just glorified workshop content feels a bit greedy too.I would give this title a mixed review but considering that this title lies at very positive right now, I'll go with a negative one instead.It's a bit sad that this game is going the exact same Paradox DLC route like their grand strategy titles. I hoped this game would be spared from that. Alas, I was a bit delusional it seems."
0; city good
0;" I'm terrible at city-building games. JUST TERRIBLE. You know the ""city advisor"" features in most games of this type? They are ALWAOkay, so I'm not a strategic thinker, so I play city-building games like a painter with a brush, or like Tetris without the disappearing blocks. I think zero moves ahead. I can't think ahead. I'm terrible at chess, too. I just like to build things and watch thWhy does this matter in a review of Cities: Skylines? It matters because the game lets me play this way and doesn't penalize me. I can ignore city advisors, or the little twitter feed at the top of the page. I can build a sprawling eco-friendly suburbia or a toxic metropolitan nightmare, and it just lets me do it. Some people bemoan the lack of complex city-building features in this gameThe game requires absurdly high specs to run smoothly. One day I hope to upgrade my PC so I can dump sewer water into Shady Acres without an inferiority complex to dampen my malevolent glee."
0; I would call it a cozy game. You build something and hopefully it prospers
0; very entertaining
0;" If you enjoy city builders, this is the best one around. The sequel comes out soon (at the time of this writing) and promises to be even better. But this game still holds up and will serve as a great alternative for those who don't have the required hardware or the desire to play the latest version."
0; one more lane should fix it
0;" Fascinating ! Once you become the mayor, you will immerse into city building starting from small town until metropolis that hold thousands of citizen. The graphics are simply beautiful. A lots of DLCs you can buy to expand the game play. WIll continue to build more cities in future."
0; The best of the best when it comes to city building. Worth every penny! Fair prices for game and DLC. I will support them the same in Cities Skylines 2!
0;" The game itself is Okay, the DLC is a little expensive for what you get, and minimum PC specs are far greater than the specs on Store page show, so if you're going to buy/use ALL the DLC, you'll need 64Gb+ of RAM and a large SSD drive .. The ""community"" on the other hand, is toxic AF, filled with ""veterans"" and ""gatekeepers"" and ""fanbois"" of Mod Creators who attack anyone with a different point of view, and get away with it, because CO cares more about generating Hype and having ""fans"" that generate more revenue, by promoting mods, that they claim not to support, but rely on to keep the game alive, because they can't be bothered to implement certain tools in the basic game. It's a vicious cycle, and the Devs/Publisher/Moderators and Steam are all complicit in allowing it to continue.-I recommend the game if you want a casual relaxing city builder, but I do NOT recommend using the Game's Steam Discussion forums to look for help. There is nothing casual, or relaxing, about that cesspool."
0; Step 1 : Make a new city and name it something weirdStep 2 : Go bankruptStep 3 : Destroy cityStep 4 : Start another cityStep 5 : Repeat until a city doesn't go bankrupt
0; i'm not good at it but i sure do try
0;" This is a pretty great game that is hidden behind shockingly predatory business practices. I bought this game near launch and really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to buy its first couple DLC packs. But eventually, more and more DLC came out. Today, even during a sale in which most of the DLC is 50% off, the remaining DLC would cost me well over $100 and most of these expensive DLC packs contain content that really should've been in the base game. Additionally, I want to echo many of the other complaints I'm seeing in reviews: 1) the new launcher is pointless and tacky, and 2) the new privacy policy that locks you out of the game if you don't wish to share all of your personal information with Paradox is pretty absurd and not a great way to treat fans."
1; Crashes every time you load it up
0; very good so far
0; Cities: Skyline is one of the best modern city-builder games right now. Its support to the modder community will bring us great joys.
0; This game made me realise i hate car traffic.
0;" This is Demo version of Cities Skylines 2 where you been ""helping"" developers for about 10 years and paid for addons to make CS2"
0;" Cities: Skylines is a game that has captured my heart with its immersive gameplay and extensive city-building possibilities. As a fan of strategy games, I find myself enamored by the meticulous planning and creative freedom this game offers. From managing resources to constructing a bustling metropolis, Cities: Skylines delivers a satisfying and engaging experience.One of the standout features of Cities: Skylines is the sheer depth of its strategic gameplay. Balancing the needs of your citizens, managing infrastructure, and ensuring the smooth functioning of your city requires careful planning and decision-making. The game offers a wealth of options and tools to create a city that reflects your vision, from zoning areas to constructing roads, buildings, and utilities. The satisfaction of witnessing your city flourish and thrive under your guidance is unparalleled.Furthermore, the modding community surrounding Cities: Skylines is exceptional. The availability of mods allows players to enhance and customize their gaming experience to suit their preferences. Whether it's adding new building assets, adjusting gameplay mechanics, or introducing unique features, the modding support offers a limitless array of possibilities to expand and enrich your city-building adventures.Cities: Skylines also boasts an impressive selection of DLCs, which bring additional content and features to the game. While the DLCs enhance the gameplay experience and introduce new challenges and assets, it's worth noting that they can be quite expensive. However, for players seeking further variety and depth, the DLCs offer a wealth of options to explore and expand their cities."
0;" This city-builder has something for everyone, and mine is trying to create the most efficient public transport networks.Also happens to be one of the easiest games to pass the time on: I remember spending entire days without sleep, building cities block by block without noticing the passage of time."
0;" Great creative game! It lets me build all my ideas and I am always excited to come home from school and play this. So much customization, unlike free alternatives like SimCity Build it. Truly a remarkable video game, I 100% recommend."
0; because there is so much to and like its never ending and that is the good thing about cities skylines
0; best city simulation game
0;" It is a very good game and probably worth buying. It is the monetization of the game I have a problem with. The game has 10 small DLC packs that all cost at least 13 USD, some more. Small as in they add little and with a limited focus. This probably wouldn't be a problem but becomes a problem with Cities Skylines without DLC and even with mods is rather poorly featured. Nearly every aspect of the game feels underdeveloped and plain. As if the game was created only to be the skeleton of platform to sell DLC rather than a great game with DLC adding on to it. It feels very much like an ice cream cone, with no ice cream. Paradox will spoon feed you ice cream one small flavor at a time but expects you to pay a premium for that ice cream. The entire collection of DLC often goes on sale but even at 50% off it is tough to recommend and it is only going to get more expensive.It is a great game but has no peers in terms of price. Other studios now deliever the quantity and quality of content comparable to these DLC packs for free. Which adds value to the purchase. Cities Skylines does not add value but adds cost to aquire more than the bare minimum. Paradox is not obligated to give anything for free but 133 dollars and counting while ON SALE is stupid no matter which way you cut the cake."
0;" Ahh, SimCity 5 *cough* Cities Skylines, As someone who has put over 150 hours into the game, I believe it is a good game.It is a very addicting after a few minutes due to it just having so many things to do. I have spent 12 hours without even knowing it spending time building a city. The DLC is a tiny bit expensive but I believe it is worth it. Overall I would rate it 8.5/10. The reason i give it a 8.5 is because of some aspects of the game, here are a few of them: No Seasons, Offices Not Having Enough Buyers, Performance Drops In Bigger Cities ( depends on your computer. ), etc. I hope this helps your buying decision."
0; It is fun and addictive
0;" If you've ever played Cities: Skylines and thought, ""I wish they made a follow-up to this,"" play Cities: Skylines with mods."
0; I have enjoyed playing city skylines on PC and PlayStation. I am looking forward to the brand new game!
