4, Maybe introduce entering in gas station market in first person to buy food or energy drink for increase time for driving without sleep
4, Make it more real in that way
4," Maybe add police cars chasing you for speeding or red light violation in cities (if option for tickets are turned on), or add speed cameras that can sent u a ticket for speeding that u must pay on borders in order to exit a country or something like that"

4,Am i suppose to repurchase all those DLC's everytime the game is getting updates?
0, Who knew dodging merging Audi A3s could be loads of fun
4, A unique game in the world of car simulators not because its (really) very realistic physics or great graphics
4, You can find these in many other modern ones
4, But because its authentic representation of a trucker's life as it is in his or her every day life
4," Long roads scattered with trouble of all kinds, weather, police rules that one must follow"

4,"While ETS2 excels in many aspects, it falls slightly short of perfection in a few areas"
4, The absence of road imperfections on non-highway routes detracts from the realism

4, I've known about ETS2 a while before buying it and it looked ok and somewhat fun but when I did buy it when it was on sale earlier this year
4,I did not expect to have this much fun
4, It's so relaxing to drive around with a radiostation of the country you're driving in and the fact you don't understand a word of it makes it more immersive and fun
4, But it can also be stressfull when you can manage to stop just in time for the traffic light for example

0, keep flipping my car over! trash game dude
4, I honestly find the game really fun! The different features and mechanics in the game and the different varieties of trucks in this game and being able to have your own company is what makes this game insanee
4, It would be great if the deve added more interaction in the truck and more obstacles to face instead of just driving on and on
4, Also I feel like this would be a perfect game if there were bigger cities to drive through cuz I sometimes get bored just driving in a highway for a longer duration
4, Also they should add more turning points in my opinion so you would be actually making some move's instead of driving straight for a long time
4, Anyways I find Euro Truck Simulator 2 an amazing game and I love to chill listen to music and drive around

4, The Skyrim of Trucking
4,If you have played Skyrim and then uncovered the Mods of Skyrim (not a fashion statement) then you will understand
4," For those that haven't, ETS2 (and its counterpart ATS/American Truck Simulator) is not just a good game because of the developers and their commitments to improving and expanding the game world but also because it boasts a HUGELY BIGGLY active community that continues to create, and update mods"
4,The game is what you would expect from a game that A
4, has trucks and B
4, is a simulator

4, You can create a trucking empires and pretend you are on an A&E or Channel 4 documentary series

0," real life simulator,i feel like i'm driving in real"
4, Really good game it is absolute impressive for a game to have such good graphics and gameplay after 10 years it works on my 2013 laptops intel GPU and it runs at around 30 fps when I have shadows to low and mirror quality to medium
4," This game is incredible, I would diffidently recommend this game if you like to drive and just chill"
0, amazing
4, the game is great and enjoyable but the problem is along the way it gets boring i so wish it was more realistic like being able to inspect your truck and be able to see you driver and walk around your truck also weigh bridges and being able to manager your truck company for real adding traffic officers who stops you and add your head office to be able to see all my trucks and my drivers going in and out the place i hope things will change sooner
0, Nice game and very fun to play with your friends!
4, This is one of those games where you make it happen
4," The adventures, the travels and distant gorgeous visuals are all there to create a peaceful, and fairly sort of realistic adventure"
4," You get it all, a business, so many opportunities to drive for quite literally IRL hours and hours for jobs"
4," Hire people, crash your truck from violently speeding and ignoring all warnings, notices and speed camera violations"
4," Watch as the most accurate human simulation occurs, trucks deciding to merge without warning, cars without using their indicators, frustrating corners that make you wonder why the hell you're doing this, and then you'll come back tomorrow"
4,"I adore this game, I adore the people who make it, who mod it lovingly, the designers who bring incredible DLC's with interesting locations"
4, I would genuinely love to spend as much as possible on this game and right now I'm hyped for the West Balkans DLC
4,"Usually when I play this, I'm actually multitasking, I'm speeding at 80mph on the roads swerving around, jamming to music and daydreaming what I'll be writing later (author moment)"
4," It's so peaceful, enjoyable and often times downright hilarious especially when you total your truck just 30 minutes from your destination ahaha (This is sarcasm, help me"
4,")If you're someone who plays for the chaotic fun, this is the game for you"
4," If you're a trucker who just wants to switch off and play a game simulating it, this is the game for you"
4, If you just find it funny to see how fast you can go when you're meant to be driving 20mph as the police frantically have mental breakdowns and dread seeing you on the roads again and again
4, This is the game for you
4," If you like looking at cool towns and some slightly questionable roundabouts, turn offs, funny and weird roads that have arrows covering them so you can't go down them, this is for you"
4,"Own a business! Hire people! Fire them because they don't learn fast enough (Looking at you, Sally"
4,"), Get the trucks of your wildest dreams, expand your truck business empire, somehow go that deep into debt that you can never recover from crashing your truck too much, use the funny haha files to just add some money on OR sell that truck of yours"
4," Deal with the bank being silly (Pay this back in a few days they said, they'll charge you more by the day they did) You can just do it all"
4,"Seriously, I go on and off this game but every time I load it up I know for a fact that I'm going to be in for one hell of a ride, and you will too! Give it a go, play it your way and have fun the whole time"
4," It's one of my best purchases yet, and I just love it"
4, I'm not even into trucks funnily enough but something about this reeled me in and now I'm stuck with the fishies
4," Or would that be trucks?? I'm not sure, don't put your trucks into water please, they don't know how to swim :(If I could have anything, I think it would be really, really funny if there was a rare, rare chance on those lonely roads of a night time to have a UFO just in the distance pass by"
4, It's not realistic but come on
4, Some of those roads are so creepy
4,"Thank you to everyone who made this game what it is, the community for adoring it, and for you my dear little reader for spending the time to go through this novel worthy comment"
4," Come join us, you can't escape it"
0," doesn't matter if you have your mother's laptop you can still play it, it also give's you two free DLC"
4, I absolutely love this game in almost every way
4, I love the American truck simulator just as much as this one but tend to not play as often because of the low amount of players on Truckers MP
4," This game is a really awesome, and cool game to play!!! The reason why mostly I play it is, because I like anything that is a big vehicle, so one day I had searched a game, and this is what I'd found! From now on, I've really enjoyed the game, and I really hope you do to!!!!!"
0, Very sexy game
0, i really enjoy this game

4, Fun game
4,Does turn into grind if you dont want to have to drive every in-game day
4,Pickup and delivery locations are cookie cutter in every city
4," The city will have different routes, but when you get to a location, its generic layout"
4,Quarries pickup/delivery make your eyes bleed until you memorize the cookie cutter quarry
4,"Achievements, this one is behind a big DLC pay wall"
4,Q
4,O
4,L
4,: I personally ran into is being forced to drive at least 2 hours a day
4," Appears from guides that there were ""exploits"" in the past that let you advance a day without driving"
4," If you want to focus on expanding your business (in my case over 50 trucks and 50 drivers), you are still required to drive yourself at least 2 hours to advance time and driver experience/income"
4," You are not allowed to ""retire"" from driving to expand the business"
4, My interest level quickly dropped in advancing my business and drivers
4,"So at this point, I may play again just to drive"
4, Not to advance my business as its now a driving grind only
4, If they had a threshold of at level 25 or so to retire and run the business from the office and fill in once or twice a week for a sick driver
4, I'd play more
0," Love this game, Do not forget to Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat while playing it."

0, Dont go fast around tight corners trust me
0, amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4," Download with passion, uninstall with anger every time"
4,"-This is a truck simulation, don't learn from Grand Theft Auto"
4," Why you make your stupid AI traffic ramming into players?-Ghost traffic cars, especially police cars, suddenly disappear in from of me, can the devs explain wtf is going on?-Traffic barriers spawn instantly in from of me, don't even have time to dodge, again wtf is this?-And do please add some extra mass to your plastic trucks trucks of tons don't easily flip over by just hitting a traffic sign"
4,Don't you devs ever play your own game??? You are ruining your game into a piece of trash with useless updates that only turn the game more glitchy and buggy and worthless and worse asfSCS burgers
4," Actually my first time recommending a driving simulation game, but the only reason I put it on top of many known racing franchise is: It's just so chill and relaxing"
4,"Sure, if you're already a truck driver, or your daily routine involves heavy traffics, then this game can be painful"
4," However, if you are a light-travel person but with heavy workload like me, you'll surprisingly found that driving on a highway can be so relaxing"
4," Just listen to the radio and drive, no need to think"
4,"Also, strongly recommended if you're learning to drive"
4," I know it's a truck, but it does train your awareness on the highway and on intersections"
0, daddy likes do transport drugs

4," I sometimes open my favorite podcast, sometimes my music playlist, and sometimes youtube videos that I want to consume but don't have to watch, I explore the surroundings with beautiful views, the most chill and enjoyable activity in the world"
0, Best truck driving simulator I've seen.
1, When i was playing this game and driving my truck the wipers are't stoping after many tries
0, prefect
0, very good 10/10
0, great game
4," Overall the game is awesome, graphics are good, but DLC maps are kind of sketchy and is visible that they didn't put a lot of effort in to city locations etc"
4," The base of the game is worth the price, i suggest you to try this game"
0, Food game
0, okey i like it
0, it good job
0, love game
0, good excuse to leave your family
0," very very hot, makes me horny"
4," This game has been one of the best games I have ever played, It's one thing playing on a controller on this game but a 900* degree steering wheel really makes it different"
4, If you're looking for a fun realistic game this is for you
4, I have just got over 100 hours logged on this game and there will be many more
4, I also recommend getting promods once you have all the map DLC's as it makes the game look a lot like real life with real roads and scenery
4,"Always play this game with a controller or a steering wheel and pedals, would not recommend keyboard and mouse for a realistic experience"
4, Get some of the truck DLC's as-well so you can customise your truck as you like it with more options
4,"But yeah overall, 10/10 game you should defo buy especially right now because its very cheap and worth it"
4," Hope this helps you, happy trucking"
0," Good Casual Game , Yes the graphics are not the best but the game gets better with every update"
0, Great mods!
0, It's a very good simulation of the experience of running a small logistics company
0, this game made me love country music
0, rahhhhhhhhhhh drive truck
0," very goog and sometimes boring,because i rire in line"
0, fun game
4, I honestly find the game really fun! The different features and mechanics in the game and the different varieties of trucks in this game and being able to have your own company is what makes this game insanee
4, It would be great if the deve added more interaction in the truck and more obstacles to face instead of just driving on and on
4, Also I feel like this would be a perfect game if there were bigger cities to drive through cuz I sometimes get bored just driving in a highway for a longer duration
4, Also they should add more turning points in my opinion so you would be actually making some move's instead of driving straight for a long time
4, Anyways I find Euro Truck Simulator 2 an amazing game and I love to chill listen to music and drive around
4, As a Simulator it is very good
4, No Complaints
4, Things which can be improved is the weather
4, The rains are very unrealistic and they need to add snow too

4,"This game unfolds as a captivating journey, equally appealing to avid simulation enthusiasts and casual players seeking a different kind of adventure"

4," chill game , no cars ramming, jobs which gives good money"
4," Ps, you can remove the limiter and the truck are not limited on 70 miles/hr"
0, Really good game
0, this is a great game and i would recommend it to people who like trucks
4," It is an excellent game, but it is not for everyone, literally the game is to drive, drive, drive, you must have strong mind to endure that as it can become tedious or very monotonous, as simulation experience is 10/10 however not being a triple AAA game loses touch in terms of graphics and scenery, something I really liked is the simulation of secondary factors such as similar driving fatigue, something I did not like but could implement would be to make stops to eat and be more awake to endure more on long roads, Another implementation that I really liked was that you can put your own playlist to make the road more educational, in conclusion I highly recommend the game if you like driving, being inside a cabin watching the instrument panel and everything is educational, having to stop to rest or to refuel is an excellent detail, I recommend it but with DLC maps because it does not have many open places and with DLC your experience changes a lot!"

4," It's a great game to wind off after a day of work or if you generally have a stressful life, you can just boot it up and play"
4," While there's no storyline or characters or cutscenes, it's mundaneness makes it great"
4,I would REALLY recommend this game
4, IF! it was actually optimized
4," A 2012 game on medium graphical settings should give me more than 40 frames with a PC that runs much more ghraphically demanding games at around 100 frames, but hey, maybe that's just my opinion"
