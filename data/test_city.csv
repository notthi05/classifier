0;" Cities: Skylines is a true masterpiece of urban simulation gaming. Its stunning visuals, attention to detail, and immersive gameplay combine to create an unparalleled city-building experience. Whether you're a fan of the genre or a newcomer, this game is an absolute must-play. Get ready to unleash your creativity and embark on an incredible journey of urban planning and management."
2; Doesn't scale well with 4K display with resolutions even as as low as 1280 x 720. Hopefully part 2 will be more 4K friendly and have options in the UI to adjust size of text in game play. I'm glad I didn't pay for all the DLC....
0; Good if you are into civil engineering stuff
0; Pay to enjoy later game
0;" Very fun and engaging city builder, the DLCs are a little on the expensive side. I reccommend you play through to the Megalopolis accomplishment for at least one city before deciding to buy any. Either way, great game so far"
0; Good Game but ♥♥♥♥ their DLC Monetization
0; very realistic
0; Really cool city builder/simulation. Biggest downside is the shear amount of content locked behind a DLC paywall. Some of the DLC's like Natural Disasters should've been included with the base game.
0; will boost your creativity
0; A great city builder/manager game!
0;" This game still receives a big positive review, but I'm a bit disapointed with 2 things:- the last patch/update, It made the best mods uncompatible with the game, some of them like 81 tiles were essential.- The DLC policy is becoming insaneBut this is still by far the best city building game existing and without a doubt you should have it"
0; Best game ever. Excited to see City: Skylines 2 soon!
0; Really awesome game.
0; I'm not good at it and its still fun
0;" Huh, apparently I never made a review for this game... I love it... I just dont love how paradox is milking it, especially for a long time. Now they are finally coming out with a CS2 great i guess, but feels a bit late. Not to mention I feel like CS2 is gonna blow and they will most likely milk that game too regardless how well it does. CS1 I recommend buy with a select few dlc's and some mods... As for CS2 I recommend waiting and saving your money"
0;" Take in small doses, you'll lose track of time / life."
0;" Love this game, but the DLC spam is getting out of hand"
0; game
0; Very entertaining
0;" love it, but the road construction is always confusing lmao"
0; fantastic game.
0;" Massive time sink that's really well done. Some minor annoyances, but all games have these."
0; Very fun optimization and city planning game.
0; Gives me hours of enjoyment and relaxation
0; This is what Sim City should have been...
1; The game fun but it need more alive style like theotown has many more stuff to put into without any micro transaction i hope they gave a discount to the exspansion pack so i can (maybe) baught it
0; This is a great game I've built many great cities and l'l be making sure I get citieskylines 2
0;" Circle of life1: Build a functional city with beaches, theme parks and sports arenas, etc with happy people and a great quality of life2: Blow it up with 70 meteor strikes3: Do it all over again"
0; Very addictive game
0;" Played a ton on the Playstation and wee bit on PC. The gist is it scratches a city sim itch every once in a while, but is altogether a very bland affair. The cookie cutter principles are getting stale real quick: Zone residential, until demand for industrial and commerce kicks in, fulfill that need - rinse and repeat. Pepper over some simple public services needs and that's that.Don't expect this game to go deep and don't rely the game's mechanics to be smart/logical, particularly traffic. Your homies don't even know how to use a roundabout proper. Which is also where the fun with this game stops. It just stumbles way too often over it's own mechanics. You are basically relegated to fixing arguably non-sense issues and micro-manage instead of planning/designing a city. Micro-management should be opt-in, to nerd out if you wanted to, instead though it's the sole purpose of this game.All in all Cities: Skylines is ""meh"". No more, no less."
0; Best city SIM I've ever played!
0; This games is kind of cool put beside from that if you download ONE wrong mod the game gives your computer THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is very very bad and should not be played because it does damage to your computer
0; decent.
0;" Awesome game, I have the main DLC's and I do recommend Parklife and Industries. Really Improves the game. Vanilla (No DLC's) is also Great so, I hope you buy it if you like management/builder games."
0; Don't skip out on the traffic management mods.
1;" I bought this game, due to some error or I don't remember but I think one point it wasn't available to play thegame, so I deleted it. Know I have to pay one more time to play this game?"
0; great game especially if you have all dlcs only it can be laggy sometimes but im sure if your have a better pc than me its no issue
0; Built a zone for rich elderly folks and put a cemetery in clear view of the eldercare centers. Under the power lines and pollution maxed. I didn't want them to be happy.
0; its very good you should get it now
2; Cool to build the city but would of been nicer if some things were automated like garbage disposal
0; This game is so much better than civilization 6
0; Everything Sim City should have been.
0; This is the most relaxing game I've ever played.
0;" Fun and addictive, although DLC is quite overpriced imo."
0;" Super fun! Been watching youtube lets plays for years and supplementing my desire to play this with boring mobile games. Glad to say that, as a Mac user, I finally have a computer capable of running it and decided to dive in. Best decision I've made in a while!"
0; u expect to play for an hour but u end up missing work and divorcing your wife.
0; Epic game
0; Very cool I think cause you can make your dream city.
0;" Cities Skylines is an incredible game that has the power to transport you into a world of limitless creativity and unexpected adventures. Recently, an unexpected twist occurred when my mischievous dog ""Thanos snapped"" me out of nowhere. Amidst the chaos, I found solace in the virtual realm, where I could build and save my friend from peril using nothing but a virtual whopper. The game's immersive gameplay and endless possibilities allowed me to overcome real-life obstacles in the most unexpected and enjoyable way."
0;" As someone who has played every iteration of the SimCity series, Cities: Skylines is an absolute MUST have. It's simple, intuitive, and everything is just done extremely well. Whether you've got a big brain and love micromanaging the most complex of systems or who's more of a simpleton and likes everything streamlined for them, you'll find so much fun in this game. The devs are STILL providing new, official content--all while the modding community is nearly endless with their ideas and submissions. And with the frequent sales and bundle offerings of this game, there's absolutely no excuse for anyone to not include Cities: Skylines in their library."
0; its fun and easy!
0; it's so relaxing. Such a good game if you have ADHD/ADD. Good afk game.
0; I've genuinely become interested in going to college for architecture/city planning because of this game. I'm not a big fan of school X'D.10/10 would get student debt to be a city planner!
0; Addictive to the point that 4 or 5 hours will fly past in what seems like minutes.
0;" Its a good game, but I'm just terrible at it....."
2; The game fun but it need more alive style like theotown has many more stuff to put into without any micro transaction i hope they gave a discount to the exspansion pack so i can (maybe) baught it
0;" Really good relaxing game, stayed up late nights and good before hitting the hay."
0;" Great game, very deep , but still very accessable. You can turn on and turn off DLC at will.Cant wait for the seque"
0;" good game, great to make the hours fly by"
0; slow start and you get to see your city grow
0; i like it
0; Lots of great mod support and the base game itself is very fun and relaxing for those who like city builders.
0;" best city builder on the market, hands down."
0; This game is really good the best cities game on the market.Mods are also great in making your city look better
2;" Good but... STOP MAKING US PAY HUNDREDS FOR DLCs. The game was pretty good, however, the snowfall, mass transit, natural disasters, and industry should all come with the game. The other ones are just more of actual dlcs, but the ones I mentioned showed be put in the game"
0;" In this game you can build your own city with mods like infinite cash,auto unlock everything the game is so good.graphics:Good need average pc/laptop. Game play:Amazing"
0; cool
0;" You know a game is good when you wake up in the morning, turn on your PC, and play it until you sleep at night, skipping brushing your teeth, bathing, and even eating.For me, this is one of those games."
0; Amazing after managing to start a city.
0; Its the best city building game ive ever played. Would highly recommend.
0; WHY DO PPL DIE ALL THE TIME I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NEED TO BUILD EVERYTHUIBNG ALL THE TIME WGATB TGE FYCK NAHUII
0;" my son lots of enjoy this game,"
0;" 10/10 game, It can be frustrating sometimes but what i recommend is getting workshop mods or activating in game mods. fun game"
0;" Having grown up on Sim City and the early building games...this has taken things to the next level. Seem a little disappointed that I've missed the growth with this game, but while it might not be a ""new"" game, it's certainly new to me."
0; Fulfill every neurodivergent desire in that little brain of yours. Build a socialist-bike-filled utopia or a Robert-Moses-highway nightmare. Join us.
0; it good
0;" this game is pretty hard at first, but as you learn more about damn economics, then it all makes sense"
0; 10/10 implied sex
0;" I was very conflicted with this game up until recently. The main issue I have is this: When your city gets big enough the game is a piece of cake. There is depth in the city painter part of the game, but close to none in the management side of things. For a long time I'd play the game, after several hours my city would become extremely profitable and then I'd play for a few more hours before uninstalling and waiting for a new DLC that would add management depth. That DLC never came. The next DLC won't bring it. Unfortunately I doubt it ever will. What made me go from that level of disappointment to really liking the game? Seeing in a new light. This game is an amazing city builder. Amazing painter of cities. If you want to create a city that looks and feels like you want it to you have that ability. Building what seems like a giant county of varied and unique zones with different looking towns and purposes is the best I've ever seen. Playing this game with the intention of making my own New York or London is what it's near perfect as. The DLC just gives more tools to diversify the environment. So if picture a city in your head you can make it in this game. The opportunities are there.If you want to struggle to build and maintain it with tons of management tools this isn't for you. Overall it's a 9/10 for me"
2;" One of the best games, i really enjoyed the build mechanices. I wish they would have some sort of campaign mode or some way to compete against other cities"
0;" A peaceful city planning game. It doesn't present much of a challenge once you've figured out the basic urban planning logic. As a Paradox classic, there's a lot of DLC. The DLCs are good for extra variety after playing the standard game for a while, but I'm not sure if they're worth the price."
0; This game does not help with obsessive-compulsive disorders...
0; i love the freedom of creation this game gives
0; It's an awesome well made city builder.
0; i am slow brain and still love this game.
0; Addictive game that aged very well
0; fun fun fun
0; i think this game is hard i think you should read about it before you buy it.
2; fun city building game but i think the dlc sould be in the game for free
0;" its fun at first i couldnt figure out how it worked and didnt connect to the main highway, and then i kept going bankrupt LMAO - but now its just chill. my first ""successful"" city fell to multiple death waves and ""not enough workers"" for industry (even though the demand was always at max for some reason), and i eventually lost it to my pc being wiped o7.overall a fun game to watch others play on youtube, and then to play for yourself, yet a bit frustrating to figure out if you're an idiot like me lol.also mods saved my life oml if you're struggling in your city, consider mods. they seriously help with QOL things that they'll probably add in the next game, but for now we just rely on the mod community haha.thx for reading <3"
0; really love this game. can't wait for the CS 2
0; haha silly cities
0;" One of the best city builders i have played. it is unforgiving, learn some city planning before you get into it. mods are your friend. the traffic manager is a life-savor!"
0; My best ever free time pass game!!
0;" me build city, me happy"
0;" The only current option for a decent city builder game (except for the upcoming sequel).Immerse yourself as you take the role of the city manager. Who lives where, which building builds 'nhere? (yes i made that word up) is now all in your control. Create the dream city as you do your best to solve problems within your network and provide a prospering environment for your citizens.High replay-ability, great value for the price. Incredible modding community.Base game could- however- use some of the mods for convenience during your play through. Try getting TMPE if you go into the modding for this game."
1; BEWARE!!! After the latest update the game crashes every single time you try to create a new game.
0;" The budgets in this game makes me wanna kill myself, not only that it makes me severely autistic."
0; very good game if you like city builders but they needa stop adding dlcs and do somthing else
0; addictive
0; I just want CS2 to release already. Hopefully hey build in the popular mods to default functionality into the new one. I'd pretty much pay for a cleaned up version of the first. Fantastic game all around!
0; Great fun if you love city building and management!
0; epik simcity but modern
0; Certified Banger.
1; stupid Game.. keep error
1;" I do not understand why it will not start up. Steam says it is running, but nothing happens. Want a refund. Probably a problem on my end anyway."
0; play till CS 2 comes ot
0; i like building the city hehe
0;" Addicting, fun, modern sim cities. Hard but fun."
0;" good game, worth a buy"
0; Fun game with lots of expansions and area to play with.
1;" I really feel like recommending this game because it has almost everything a city manager should have. The game generally works fine and everything is working as expected, and you can fix many flaws, make the game harder and add content through mods and the workshop.In the vanilla game (without mods) there's a bug that happens with water once your city becomes really big. If you're aiming at making a very big city you'll probably fall in this bug unless you install a mod that addresses it. Citizens will become sick without any apparent reason. Building more drain pipes and water towers won't fix it. Even switching entirely from pumping water from a water source to using water towers won't fix that, so you're basically screwed and forced to abandon your city.I'm surprised developers haven't looked into that and that issue is still a thing, but as I said, as long as you install the proper mod the issue won't happen."
0; This game is nice.
0; Great city builder.
0; Brain exercise...
0;" Fun game, although a bit of a learning curve to start with."
0;" Paradise and heaven are too far away from us itw, so we have to build it in the game. Luckily this game provides us the elements to design our own Jerusalem"
2; great game don't get me wrong but very confusing maybe a better tutorial would help new players understand whats going on and how to use everything
0;" Its a great game, but it takes time to master. Also the dlcs are not limited but are limited. A little bit of flexability could be made."
0; very good. very nice
0; Hours of fun only limited by your own imagination.
0; Great way to challenge the mind or unwind and just muck around.
0;" Well, it's a nice game but still have some flaw, especially with the traffic AI."
2; If they could just remove power-lines completely it would be great.
0;" I bought this game around New Years 2023 and gradually added DLC over time. I love the game, the continual challenges to maintain the city as it grows larger, most of the DLC-specific mechanics and of course the amazing community that creates assets and mods. I highly recommend."
0; Very chill and relaxing gaming experience. I always come back to it.
0; I like to build trains and tall buildings
0; The best city builder. hands down
0; its alright to many dlc 8/10
0; It's a babe game. Very slay.
0;" yes, hopefully second game is just somehow completely better, think sim city/roller coaster tycoon."
0; its supa fun
0; Really fun game
1;" product is faulty , there is no in game sound. You paying for broken product"
0; They just die (idk why) and then the all leave ps not a lot of money to start with.
0; This game is kind of like a sandbox and let you build and design city however you like. Requires to learn and understand the correct layout to maximize the flow and income.
0; mantap
0; This game tests your mental ability to solve and control certain problems and people and teaches you ways to solve problems that their is many ways to find a solution and sometimes are very easy.
0;" A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this before I go. I don't know how many people will see this: but I recommend to you to play this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything is masterfully crafted. If you read it, thank you and good bye."
0;" My wallet is crying. I love this game and would recommend to anyone wanting to build their own city, but doesn't quite have enough money to do it IRL"
0;" Good game, very scummy dlc wise though."
0; it was very realistic and addicting I liked it a lot
0; Cities skylines is a beautifully created simulation game that has changed the landscape of city building games.
0; Probably the best city builder simulation game in the world.The game gets even better with some of the well developed addons that you can find in the Steam Workshop for this game.
0; godddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddxdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
0; it was fun. but a lot could improve.
0;" Relaxing, challenging (I am still not a pro, sorry), entertaining. Love it."
0; I would argue its the best City builder ever made.
0; it is fun
0;" A very fulfilling city building game. Includes very granular controls, and allows you to include mods which elevate the level of gameplay significantly."
0;" Okay, I don't usualy write reviews, but I chose to (this time).I love this game. It's one of the best city builders I have played within the past decade. The other one is Cities XL, which I played heavily before Cities Skylies came out (unfortunately that game, Cities XL, is outdated and just wearing: not good for long play).This game, however, if lively, bright, inviting, smooth, and fun.I know a lot of people have an issue with Paradox's ""DLC policy"" but you're not required to buy DLC to enjoy this game. The game itself is fun and has updates on its own. Also, the game is open to mods, which means you can add assets and other things created by other fans of the game from the workshop without having to worry about the DLC....and I wonder jsut how many people may argue about the DLC may have bought an expansion pack for an online game (WoW or any other,... Final Fantasy 14 in my case). I can't knock these worked on mini-expansions small prices when I spend $50 on an expansion for an online game that allows me to use 3 new jobs and travel to a new area...even thought I will be right next to people who can access these things without me having them (meaning the $50 was just a glorified unlock code, essentially)I mean they could wait and make a massive expansion and release a fullsized expansion but I don't see the issue with sevelal small ""expansions"" called DLC. DLC that one could wait until it goes on sale and buy them a bit along.And that is why I recommend this game. A company that continually wants to expand on their property to keep it alive. If you see it as them just being greedy, you're not oblidged to buy it, but it's clear that people are still buying them. Why? because they enjoy the game.That's the point of games. To enjoy them. Why not have more things added to further that enjoyment. Much less have stuff added that is official, stable, and compatable.Or, if you're not happy with it, you're free to go buy the old and outdated city builders that avaiable on Steam here. SimCity4 is available...but you'll never get to see any new content or enjoy any mods with that game."
1; A good city builder but there is one problem I have with this game: Endless errors when trying to place an airport.
0; This game is great if you're an Engineer/Surveyor.
0; Its great!
1; crashes when I try to launch it and is the only game I own that won't run
0; Pretty gaming my first experiences include flooding a city best game of the century
1;" Can't get the damn thing to actually start.Log announcing 115 hours of play. Some process might have been running, nothing actually displayed on the computer itself. attempts to stop or restart only end up in ... nothing: various processes keep running, nothing displays anywhere ever, rebooting the computer requires manually killing the runtime processes with the task manager."
1;" Dox I know you're probably busy with Cities Skylines 2 and Stellaris, but can you explain why does my game keeps getting stuck on the loading screen"
1;" Loads every asset, including unused ones, into ram whenever you try to go into a map. This is the only game I have ever run into this with, that reeks of poor optimization/programming, because why do I need to load all 5 other maps when I'm only playing on 1 map. If the game crashes and you have 16 gb of ram, this is the likely reason why, my old computer crashed all the time because of this. Haven't crashed yet on my new pc, however it still tries to take up 20+gb of ram."
2;" 10/10 Best city builder, but needs more roundabouts! xD"
0;" good game for losing your mind to a city in the sky, so many ways to make a city without or with uniform."
0;" whole town lived of poo water for 6 months, reminded me of home 10/10"
0; New favorite game
0; A classic but still worth it. Engaging and intelligent. Always fun.
0;" I love building the worst possible city, purposefully designing it to fail while charging my residents absorbent prices and giving little to nothing back. - Mayor of Los Angeles"
0; fun game but i dont want to spend like 400$ on a bunch of pixels
0;" For the record I LOVE this game and it's my go-to de-stressor in any situation. Seeing how much it's grown since 2015 with all of the updates and expansions has been an incredible display of progressing a game from it's vanilla state.But just skimming at the content section of the store page, there should NOT be $300+ worth of DLC. We cannot keep letting Paradox get away with their greedy practices when the sequel to Cities: Skylines finally comes."
2;" I love the game. Have played it a lot.But...I need the mods from the workshop to be enjoying the game. And Paradox keeps breaking the mods. Again, and again.I stopped playing for a while, and gave it a try again. But two days ago they updated the game again, and I can't play it. It's like I am waiting for game 2 so I can play game 1 without any new gamebreaking updates.Please stop ruining the game. It's a fantastic citybuilder game when I can play it with the tools I want to use."
0; I wanted to build a car-free city but apparently that is too far-fetched of a fantasy for this game.
0; Very fun not that hard many expansion packs. My Rate 10 out of 10
0; fthr
0;" went bankrupt in 5 minutes, otherwise very cool, caused suffering to thousands"
0; you can create your little world there and it's fun
0; Fantastic sandbox..... Have always loved CS always will.
0; Best Game Ever.
0;" An amazing city builder -probably the best. Definitely has a learning curve and costs a large sum of $$$ to get all the dlc. However I would say that the price is worth it and this game can provide you with hundreds of hours (I have played more than 29 hours in total, as I own the game on xbox as well). The community for the game is amazing and can help you learn the game in no time. 9/10"
0; build ♥♥♥♥♥
0;" I'll just fix the metro and then I'll go to bed.I'll just fix this round-a-bout and then I'll go to bed.Oh, I'll just delete these abandoned buildings and then I'll go to bed... promise.Wait, I need to fix this road, then I'll go to bed.And the buildings."
1;" i actually like the game, but after buying more than 10 DLCs, the game cannot run smoothly. please fix"
0;" Until there is vertical snap to grid (or otherwise sculpting tools that don't leave the world looking messed up forever once you used them) I would not recommend this game. 1990 something's Roller Coaster Tycoon's terrain management worked better than the system this game uses, so it's not like this is an impossible ask."
0; Best city building game ever .
0; It's awesome
0; Its pretty ok
0;" Very fun at start,base game kind of bland."
0;" I hesitated buying this game for the longest time. If you grew up playing sim games like simcity then most modern citybuilders are pretty aweful and I usually avoid buying games with dlc. However I was really surprised at how well rounded and detailed this game is. After almost 2000hours of my life to this game, it is one of my favorites. The industries dlc does need to be redone its really unbalanced, almost cheating, and supply/demand is just broken/nonsensical. This game totally scratches the simcity itch, and it supports mods."
1;" this game is nothing like the adds. i was playing and i made me best city and then the happiness went down, and everyone was sick and it all just started to crash and my city was destroyed. over all2/10 do not recommend"
0; love it. great city builder
0; The game is fun if you like buildings and making cities
0;" It's certainly not perfect and often becomes Traffic Simulator, but it's the best city builder out there IMO"
0; It is really fun to play
0;" runs poorly, with workshop mods its playable and it became my favorite game."
0; V good
0; only play if you want to go insane
2; Overall A great city builder but the original game should have included things like roundabout builder etc that you can get free as a patch
1;" i bought this game and was excited to play it, but it will not open when i click play, it will say that its running but when i pull up task manager nothing shows as running besides steam. Googled it and no help, VERY disappointing"
1;" Game is suddenly crashing as it loads. At this point, just save your money and wait for C:S II"
0; the best city planing game so far
0; its really cool to build a city
0; Best time I've spent on a game
0;" This game is great. Especially with mods. Huge shoutout to those who have made mods and maps. Definitely check it out. Skylines2 has been announced though, so maybe take it easy on the DLC."
0; Recommend
0; When your cities are Skylines
0; good game
0; It's a very creative and fun game where you can control your own city to either lead it to destruction or prosperity.
0; You need to pay DLC to get all the achivements
0;" I really recommend this game if you love the creativity of customizing a city. Sadly, without the DLCs, the game is kind of bland so I do recommend finding a guide on the best DLCs to buy/find. Just make sure not to have too many because some computers can't handle too many DLCs. Though at this point, I recommend waiting for Cities Skylines 2."
0; very engaging and relaxing game
0; Hands down the single best game that has ever been created in this genre.
0; Yes. Good. I like the tiny people. They exist because I will it so. I am the power man
0; its good
0;" If CS1 is this good, CS2 is going to be amazing"
0; i cannot comprehend how one game can eat my entire ram
0; Very relaxing but stimulating game. I cant wait to play the second one coming soon.
0;" Paradox insists on pushing more and more DLCs that do stuff already available through mods instead of starting a new with an updated engine like this game very clearly needs. Was a good game when it came out and for the subsequent years, and nowadays it still is the top citybuilder but only because it has no direct competitors."
0; The joyless cash grab version of Simcity 4
0; An amazing game to lose yourself into. The possibilities are endless on what you can do. Ive already clocked 22 hours on this and will be streaming this on twitch because a ton of people are excited about it. Its kinda like sims on steroids!!
0;" Throw SimCity in the garbage, this game has everything you'll ever want from a City building Sim."
0; Paradox provides no instruction or tutorial on how to play.
0; very fun and addictive haha yes
0; cant wait for 2
1;" I want to recommend this game. I really do. I just can't.It's so riddled with bugs and issues that it makes it so inhumanly infuriating to play that I almost requested a refund after over 2 months of playing it.I haven't done anything that would break the game.This game has resulted in the following14 Vague Error Messages3 Forced Restarts18 Random CrashesAnd I had to potentially risk corrupting all of my data for this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game.Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves Paradox.1/10Edit: just realised that this game actually partially corrupted my PC. Again, Paradox and Colossal Order can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves."
0; Great yet complicated game.Loving it
0;" I got it when it was free for 3 days, and then it said I have to buy it after the sale."
0; Never played this game before
0;" I WORKED ON MY CITY FOR 25 HOURS A DAY, ONLY FOR IT TO GET FLOODED BY A TSUNAMI. IF YOU DONT HAVE SPECIAL DLC'S, YOU CANT SAVE YOUR CITY FROM DISASTER!!!"
0; amazingly fun
0;" Cities Skylines is much like Sims:I'd play this game for 3 days straight no problem,but then I'd happily not touch it for 9 months."
0; my favourite game on steam ever.
0;" Have you ever played a game and wondered where the entire day went. That's Cities Skylines in a nutshell. There are so many ways to play this game there's not enough time or space in this review to do it justice. This game is perfect for creative types and those that like challenging game play. This game is a blast both modded and vanilla.I do recommend adding Mass Transit, After Dark, Parklife, Green Cities, and Industries DLC, in that order. Sunset Harbor is also a great addition to the game. If you like City Builders, you can not go wrong with Cities Skylines."
0; This is the game SimCity wishes it was.
0;" This game is confusing, unclear, unsatisfying, and overall just a mess.It's fun at the first few stages, but when it comes to managing a larger city, things get really confusing if you didn't plan ahead.Or maybe that's just a skill issue of mine. Idk, I can't really say much about it. Give it a go when it's on sale or something."
0; just everything other than controls
0; Don't bother - this game can not be played without mods and none of the mods are ever truly compatible with all the updates and changes. You'll get super frustrated with this garbage.
0; very fun and engaging i played for 12 hours after i got it
0;" Love this game. Mod and asset makers are fantastic and every single DLC adds an amazing layer to the game, but it is still fun without the DLCs. Super excited for Cities: Skylines II and will keep playing this for the months to come."
0; so real
0;" Very good game, everything is nicely detailed. Only problem is, that there are too many DLCs, which are very pointlessly placed (Small details, some stuff that should be in base game)"
2;" Please incorporate built-in fillers such as plazas, concrete, cobbles, asphalt, etc., and include the ability to modify the plaza of an existing building, At least do it for CS II. In actual cities, you wouldn't find empty grass spaces between two high-rises."
0; Starve your citizens!
0;" Probably my favorite sandbox/creative game ever along with the likes of Minecraft.Been playing it since almost launch and keep getting addicted, well worth a buy - especially during sales.The only complaint really is the usual Paradox Interactive milking of DLC, so look for a list of the best DLC to get before buying any. Looking forward to the sequel when it does come!Don't forget to have a decent amount of ram (16+) if you want to get a decent amount of addons."
2;" STOP ADDING YOUR LAUNCHER TO GAMES ON STEAM! If I buy your game on Steam, I don't want to buy a shortcut to your launcher just to launch the damn game. The same thing happened to Kerbal Space Program too, quit it."
0;" it's a fun, strategy, big brain game innit"

0; Fuuuuuuun
0;" Nice, relaxing fun. Mainly an exercise in networks and traffic management, but plenty of extra things going on."
1;" so I bought this like a year ago and I wasn't fully inactive on it I visited it like twice a week or something, I turned my pc on one day and it got taken out of my library, no explanation, just a blank message saying that it has been taken out of my library"
2;" It's a good game, its just certain things I think should be at least free. Extra cars cost $2 and so on. Other then that, its a cool game!"
0; its a nice game
0; Easy game to turn your brain off to the outside world and overthink about what you're gonna place next
0; Verry nice mgame if ypu have the time
1; This game broke my computer twice also its so unrealistic and the mods that do make it realistic take like 2000 hours just to load a city so this game sucks and I do not recommend it if you want a game like this but better play Workers and Resources Soviet Republic.
0; One of the best ever
0; Bad traffic system but the rest is great
1;" View controls suck, cludgy, and have a delay between key presses and screen changes. Got locked into night view and can't change it. Sewer system refused to set up properly, drove the citizens out and now can't get new citizens after rebuilding the sewer. Can't find controls to make it work."
0;" Paradox has a severe lack of respect for its long-term customers. They keep pushing patch updates for mediocre DLCs that destroy all of your mods and ruin your previous saves. After years of playing, I no longer recommend. I'm sick and tired of a game that I've been over $100 for being useless after an update for a DLC I have no interest in buying.Other games that I play don't destroy mods with their updates, nor do they ruin saved games that players worked weeks on before being destroyed overnight. Paradox is nothing but a cash cow."
0;" this game has properly milked me for my money and I couldnt be happier. The base game is absolutely fantastic and very easy to understand and get started, but as you progress you learn more and more until the game is entirely more challenging but fun. I recommend green cities dlc and most of all industries (which in itself is a game). These add alot while remaining simple but if you want complex if you fell like diving in the deep end. I am excited for CS2 3 months has never felt longer."
0; debt simulator
0; Excellent Game! Even better with Mods & DLCs!
0;" i made a thriving city called ""poopcity"" and this game is awesome!!!!!!"
0; This thing with mods it's amazing.
0; Fun game with tons of DLC that makes the game more interactive and unique.
0;" What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? CO understood the brief and delivered. When EA released the dumpster fire that was the latest Sim City installment, CO came along and saved the day. It's everything EA *could* have delivered but didn't care enough to try.The game is incredibly feature-rich, even without the expansion packs and the exceptional work of the modders make the game even better.The only downside I see to this game is that some (not all) of the DLC/expansion packs just look like a blatant cash-grab, with some of them costing more than they should do considering how little they add to the overall experience. Some others feel like an afterthought - the Campus add on, for example, doesn't really have much impact on your city at all. Industries, however, does. Don't get me started on the radio station add on packs...That said, it's very easy to sink a silly amount of hours into this game, and critically, not regret doing so. That's a win in my books."
0; One of the better Building Sim games.
0; the road building is unbelievably awful
2; this game needs a battle royal
0; favorite game since anime world war 2
0;" 1. Pirate game2. Feel bad and buy game because it's such a good city sim3. Spend several hours building a functioning city4. Reach 13,000 population5. Make huge investment to build dam to solve energy problems forever6. Accidentally divert the river7. City is reclaimed by the sea"
1; All old people die simultaneously. Drivers can't make a U-turn unless the road has ended. No one tries to avoid traffic jams. Twitter is annoying.10/10 for realism
0;" This game made me understand traffic flow enough to develop a malicious, indomitable hatred of the road design in my own city.Lots of content, lots of good mods to increase complexity and increase the already fairly high skill ceiling. I learned some interesting stuff about city design and development.Some of the DLC is pretty yikes. It can be way overpriced, while adding something that really shouldn't cost 10 bloody dollars. But theres still some DLC that I believe is worth the price. Increasing options, and adding potential for more city functionality. Just check the reviews and you'll find the good ones.100 hours and I spent like $50. And I'm going to play more eventually."
0; i get to play god
0; lacks elephants but still fun
0; Amazing game with great detail and realism.
0; This game takes sooooooooo much time to play. This is like playing 5 hours feels like 1 hour of playing.Possible to do almost anything thanks to mods.
0; I like no pressure building/creation games. I am into problem solving. This game scratches that itch.
0;" The best city builder. With expansions and Workshop support, this game is great to lose your self for a session."
0; Really good but the new one is coming soon
0; build the city
0; the city of phoenix arizona is a disaster and should be razed to the ground it stands on
1;" The game was crashing on startup until I removed some conflicting programs that I don't use anymore (but why should Citrix break this?). Now it won't open a world at all, it just hangs on the loading screen until I force kill the game. I want my money back."
0; I built a city.Made a pool out of waste water.Released the waste onto a city.I love destruction 10/10 Game!
0;" All of the features that make this game enjoyable weren't made by the developers, but by hobbyists in the workshop.Therefore when ever there is a major update. All of the mods break and the game is unplayable.Do NOT waste your money"
0; The best game ever.
0;" Gutes Spiel, mit Mods extrem realistisches Game auf die Spielmechanik."
2;" Cities: Skylines is a sensational city-building game that lets you craft your own bustling metropolis. It offers incredible freedom to design roads, zones, and manage essential services. The attention to detail is impressive, and the graphics breathe life into your city.The game's modding community adds endless possibilities, allowing you to personalize and enhance your experience. It's a vibrant world that keeps you engaged long after the initial excitement fades.However, there's a downside: the paid DLCs. Some players feel frustrated that additional content comes at an extra cost, especially after investing in the game. A more inclusive approach with free updates would have been appreciated."
0; played it for 8 hour straight and it felt like 30 minutes
0; absolutely infuriating and baffling
0; Tis a game.. I quite enjoy this on my laptop as i drive down highway.
2; Good but please add oily old men DLC pleeeeease
0; Just put on some relaxing music and start building ur dream city. <3
0; Burned the town while there was a tsunami going on. This is too realistic. Japan/10
0; brilliant game and fun to play
0;" The game is amazing and really fun, there are a few building limitations but mods can fix that. The base game has so much content already but I wish the dlc were cheaper."
0;" Paradox Launcher. Why do I need another launcher eating system resources and another username/password to remember? How is this even legal, I bought the game 6 years ago, it's mine, I spent good money, how can you forcibly inject unnecessary adware 6 years after the fact.Last time I spend a dime on Paradox, I'm glad I didn't spend $100+ on EU4 and all the DLCs, just downloaded it for free. ♥♥♥♥ you Paradox, you ruined my favorite game."
0; I find this game so fun!
0; I liked that i can explore making different cities the best (or worst) city ever. I also enjoy how realistic it is.
0;" its good, nothing more to say"
0; This game is an amazing city builder game. I've played sim city and it cannot compare to the new features and reality that this game shows. Eons above where it started.
0; this game is very fun and its a game of adventure and city building obv but also very architectural
0; best city builder out in steam
0; Super fun
0; make people eat ♥♥♥♥ if you put the sewage upstream from the water
0; i would like to play it again
1; I downloaded some mods and my pc crashed. 10/10
0; A lot of DLCs like in the SIMS 4.But its the best citysim i've played
0; great game for the past time
0; PLAY IT
0; its addicting
0; Spent hours making a citymade huge infrastructures all around and invoked my own policiesI flooded my city in a matter of seconds by accidentally making a dam that covered my city in poo water10/10 would waste my freetime again.
0; i love this game. play it noooow!
2;" Still enjoying the game after all this time. I would love to be able to ""follow"" specific cims throughout their lives like I did in Simcity 4. Other than that, I love the game. I have a lot of the dlc but no mods. My favorite dlc surprisingly is the parks and rec pack where you make your own theme parks and nature reserves. I highly recommend."
0;" This game has been a great de-stress activity for me! You can start with an empty plot of land and build your city from scratch. As the city grows, you have to adapt your city to accommodate a larger population as well as increasing land size. As your population gets bigger, more things become unlocked in the game such as bus stations, airports, entertainment, high-density housing/commercial property, and so forth. I enjoy that I can come back to this game whenever I want and can pick it right back up where I left off. I don't have any DLCs and still find the game to be enjoyable.If you enjoy building and designing, then you'll like this game! I feel like my own personal civil engineer."
0; Paradox Launcher bad. Game good.
0; A well designed game of constant fun.
1;" The game don't want to save even if i click on ""save"""
2;" Great game although it sure does break my heart that this games greatness is merely hindered by the fact that they like to blast loads of DLCs with unreasonable prices. They should def add a subscription service for all dlcs, kinda like HOI4, EU4, retc."
0; Its relaxing and fun if you like Architecture
1; I have trashed the game with mods and can't even load into it.
0; its a fun game
0; Stopped running.
0;" nope. first it has a launcher,then there's tos AND eulathat need to be opened before they allow you to agree.THEN they want you to sign up for some gross account.finally get to the game and can't read the text ...there is no option to increase the font size. there is no way to increase the font size. mods exist but the two I found didn't work."
0; Mediocre game until you buy allot of DLC. You lack so much functionality without. And buying the complete game for 350 Euro is just a scam.Back to the pirate ship i guess.....
0;" Good city builder, dirty marketing. 200USD of DLC's is very stupid"
