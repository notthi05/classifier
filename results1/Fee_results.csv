0,0, it's fun
0,0," this game is incredible. it's so relaxing to jump in one of these rigs and just drive and just look at all the scenery there is. the physics are realistic and each truck is beautifully detailed in just about every way. i can't really say too many negatives exist, except the traffic a.i. acts annoying at times, but i say that just makes it even more realistic to life standards of course. if you're looking for a good truck sim, then this is your thing right here. looking forward to the next dlc."
0,0, truck goes 150km/h and we chill!
0,0," great game for everybody who like economics of the truck-logistics company and/or free truck driving. have been playing ats for a while (almost finish it = more than 250 drivers) and i'm now trying the new challenge - ets2. different feeling, narrow roads, more challenging special transports, etc.highly recommend!"

0,0, it is a great game.btw if you want to download mods you should download them from modland.com because on workshop it is kinda hard to find the perfect ones.
0,2," just keep gething better and better, now with people cycling on cycle paths in some cities"
0,0," this game is literarily perfect, except maybe the fact that dlcs are quite expensive.what i liked was:1. graphics- absolutely stunning for a game made back in 20122 the radio- it blows my mind how many radios there are in this game which you can vibe to.3 realism- no wonder some people say this game is hard it's really easy to get a penalty for anything to be honest(speeding, red lights, etc)4 money system- as frustrating as it might be, its very well done, making you work every day if you did decide to take a loan, which i think some people did."
0,2, very relaxing and high quality. i recommend.
0,0, best simulator yes

0,0," very nice game but taking a loan and then repaying it can be annoying, other than that it is extremely good game i 100% would recommend"
0,0," i'm 16 and i've played this game on and off for the past 6 years or so. never fails to impress me. it's chill, and so fun. i just finished the first step for getting my driver's license, and this game has helped me in many ways. i don't even play with a steering wheel, yet it's just as educational. i also love listening to the radio stations of my home country. my parents drove me around a lot when i was a kid, and i have various memories with many cars and numerous radio stations. the nostalgia comes back to me every time. also, the game may be a bit old now, but the graphics are still very fresh and neat for their time. don't tell me you're a car/truck lover if you don't play this game!"

2,0," a legendary game that entertained millions of players with rather simple gameplay.very good experience with a wheel even if it's 10+ years old, the multiplayer mod is also a big upgrade but the dlcs are simply too many.i hope that the developers make ets3 or a combined ets + ats massive open world game with modern tech at some point."

0,2, fun relaxing game to play when you're bored
1,1, buggy and sometimes unplayable experience while running nativily in the linux port
0,0, one of the best sims on steam.... and the internet!
0,0," this game provides a relaxing challenge and a whole lot more. keep your rig in the lane, don't forget to make your turn, and don't crash. or go ahead and break all those rules, the resulting chaos is always kind of fun to figure out too.there are plenty of aids you can turn on and off that make the game no more difficult than an arcade racing game. you can also dial up the experience to be pretty darn immersive and challenging. it's totally up to you, and i think that's what i enjoy about it so much."
0,2," don't just focus on the driving, listen to something. eventually driving becomes the background activity.(anyone who follows the traffic rules is poop)"
0,0, love it. if you love trucks and driving this is for you
0,0," very good game i love the realism, idk yeah"
1,0, what's the point play is game anymore if it keeps crashing ever few mins cuz scenery loads in only a few feet from you now? i use to love playing this game but what's the point playing it now.
0,0," good game 9/10fun and realistic game, it happens to be that type of game where the visuals and scenery are perfect and how sometimes driving around hits the mood. playing the game with friends makes it 10 times funnier, especially mine, always crashing and cant drive straight. something i liked about it was the attention to detail with real life, fines, engine sound, rain etc. overall it's good and dlc's make the game better."
0,0," oddly relaxing, definitely worth it. and im going to build a lot of hours on this game it's addictive10/10 highly recommend"

0,0," i'm keith grant , and this is my review on euro truck sim , it is a very realistic game and there is loads of places to drive from all around the world it is a very fun game to play too but sadly i'm from ireland and ireland isn't in the game but on the plus it's still a great game and i recommend you to buy it ,keith"
0,2," the driving physics in euro truck simulator 2 are some of the most realistic in any video game. the trucks feel heavy and stable, and the handling is very responsive. the game also features a variety of different weather conditions, which can affect the way the trucks handle.the customization options in euro truck simulator 2 are also very extensive. you can customize your truck's exterior, interior, and even its engine. you can also hire drivers to help you with your deliveries.the open world in euro truck simulator 2 is vast and detailed. the game features a recreation of europe, with over 200 cities to visit. you can also drive through a variety of different landscapes, including mountains, forests, and deserts.overall, euro truck simulator 2 is a great game for fans of truck simulators. it is realistic, customizable, and has a vast open world to explore. if you are looking for a relaxing and immersive driving experience, then euro truck simulator 2 is a great choice."
2,0," day 1 of owning this game i put 12+ hours in to this... this game is very chill and addicting. the ai traffic does sometimes show odd behavior but there are mods that supposedly fix this. you do get allot of arbitrary parts of your route to be blocked by police forcing you to take another router, i guess it is done to keep you entertained and engaged but it does get annoying at times. i do wish the road maps were more complete but i guess that would cause issues of it's own where they cannot cut travel times as much without people noticing."
0,2," fun and relaxing to play, if you like to drive trucks, deliver stuff, and free roam."
0,0," !0 years and 4000 hours later and i'm still playing. however, it's not the same game i bought 10 years ago. it keeps getting better and better every year. the devs are always updating and adding new content. they have seasonal events, great support, and have built a great community, here on steam and on their world of trucks website.i can't say enough good things about this game. it is relaxing, fun, interesting, and challenging at times. it has stunning scenery and a ton of landmarks. what are you waiting for? go buy it already!"
1,0," when the game actually runs its a great game and i do enjoy it but unfortunately the game does have a few faults. the main fault i have found is when the game updates it never goes smoothly i always run into the same problems. after the game updates, i launch it and it gets to the loading page and then crashes and shuts down with no warning. i contact steam every time this happens and send them the crash log files and they suggest things that may be causing the crash. ill take their advise and do what ever they tell me to do and eventually it does work and the game starts working again, but a few weeks will pass and then the game will update and i run into the same problems... when i first bought the game on my previous laptop i did manage to stop the downloads and didnt have any problems for a few months but eventually after around 5 updates the game got ""too old"" and would no longer run due to needing an update so i had to update it and it did work until the next update when i ran into the same problem. i have tried to stop the updates since and cant find any way to do this. i do really enjoy the game and i think its a great game but with this problem happening every time it updates its now getting to the point where i think its not worth it as its getting now getting tiresome."
0,0, the most relaxing and fun game you can play with your friends without swearing at each other.
0,0," fairly realistic game for driving trucks.(compared to reallife)the newer truck models are good but the older models aren't,random hairpin turns on the highway. but they are working on that aswell.allround great game to goof around or to actually learn some skills(somewhat)"

0,0," euro truck simulator offers a surprisingly immersive experience for those seeking a taste of the open road. the game's attention to detail and realistic driving mechanics make it a solid choice for fans of the genre. while it may not have the flashiest graphics or groundbreaking features, euro truck simulator delivers a satisfying and relaxing journey that trucking enthusiasts will appreciate."

2,0," love the game but release the dlc and stop getting involved in politics. i want a dev to make games, not get involved in conflicts of war around the globe. i want to reccomend but how can i reccomend a dev who decides what he will release based on world events as opposed to what fans want?"
2,0," i like everything about the game simulator. i also like how u can pick your own live music, that is awesome. it would be more awesome if it had a jake brake for the trucks, an if you could walk to the side of the trailer an let down the landing gear. but that!s ok the game is still awesome! thanks guys ps would be nice if u had more steering wheels on the left side."
0,0," this game is like working 8hours of job a day and the comming hope, doing more job and enjoying it. people who like euro truck either havent tried good games or are 60 years old uncles who use their son´s pc."

0,2, this game is very relaxing. pump it full of realism mods and just turn some music on and you zone out very fun also
0,1, i like playing it on the my xbox submarine controller but sometimes i run out of air
0,1," as a truck driving simulator it is ok ish.as a truck driving simulator to see some of europe, it is absolute garbage.your avatar is a picture.you have no visible body or arms in the cabin either.your company is just a name and one of eight in game pictures that can not be changed.it is not possible to decorate your truck or trailer with the name either unless you learn to mod.the optimisation is bad.the game stutters and freezes often, and i have a high end pc.the sound will give you a headache, as the v8 sounds more like a coffee grinder than an engine, and it is noisier inside the truck than outside of it.the physics are atrocious, and this may be hard for the developers to believe, but it is actually possible to drive a truck at 80 km/h without loosing the ability to steer it just because it rains.rule of thumb is that the closer you are to the ground, the faster you can go, but not here.40 tons of flat packed steel two feet off the ground behaves exactly the same way as a container ten feet off the ground.there is no dirt and no visible wear and tear or damage. at all. anywhere, to anything.all the roads are copies of one base, so they are all the same no matter what country you are in.the gas stations, logistics centres, farms, factories and so on are also made from the same templates, thus making one in the middle of paris and the countryside of belarus identical.the rest of the scenery have slight variations, but all the trees, vegetation and buildings look like cardboard cut outs, even on ultra settings.most of the famous scenery and landmarks in europe are not present, and i`m guessing that is due to avoid paying for copyrights, since the only ones present are the ones free to use.the fact that they cut out real life companies and made up their own similar brand names instead does not help either.even the radio that some reviewers spoke so warmly about is just a collection of free to use internet stations.tldr:just another cash grab disguised as a game.nothing that is worth having unlocks as a part of the game progression.you need to buy one of the dlc`s in order to get it.want a nice paint job ? dlc.better lights or a flag in the window ? another dlc. even better tiers have their own dlc.and there are currently over 80 of them.so why do i play it ?i was over the refund limit before i realised what it actually was, and it is expensive, so i play with a ton of mods to at least get something in return. simple as that."

0,0, is good i like
0,0, it is a great game by itself personally scs has done a great job with this game!the main reason the game is super poplar is due to the multiplayer side of the game which is truckers.mp.& truckers.fm & promods.

0,0, is good
0,0," it's a pretty fun game, there are no words to describe it"
2,0," the game is a mixture of driving simulator and very high level business management, you hire drivers and buy them trucks to make more money, so that you can buy yourself more trucks. mods are not required to enjoy this game, but the community really shines at making very high quality and useful mods for the game. i especially suggest getting promods which expands the map (amongst other additions).the best thing about this game is the developers, they are communicative, engaged with the community and help to support modding and integration. this game and american truck simulator have grown tremendously with the help of fairly priced dlc and free updates.there are still things i would like to see, namely:being able to switch off certain sounds in game - such as the helicopters and planes.a better gps system which actually tells you which lane you need to be in.the ability to use the truck cabin switches, instead of just keyboard commands, similar to flight sim cockpits.more diverse and challenging parking situations and more city centre locations with obstacles.tldr: amazing game if you like driving and/or trucks, with the backing of (imo) one of the best developers around."

0,0," this is the first time i've ever left a review on steam, but i had to. while the game can't mimic certain real life situations, the amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive. i saw locations that have been faithfully recreated. the engine noises, the turn indicator, the traffic, the air brakes — are so real. the most realistic driving experience that you can have. if you like this kind of games, then ets 2 is for you. definitely can recommend to play, just a wonderful game."

0,2," step into the shoes of a trucker with euro truck simulator 2! it's like going on a never-ending road trip, where your job is to transport cargo while singing along to the radio. the game offers breathtaking scenery, realistic driving physics, and an uncanny ability to make you appreciate the joys of getting stuck in virtual traffic. just don't forget to take breaks to stretch your legs and remind yourself that there's a real world out there. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants to experience the thrill of hauling virtual goods without the pesky smell of diesel fuel!"

0,0, its an extremely repetitive driving game. but its the 18gb trailer dlc that i have to download despite not buying it that's making me uninstall and give this review.
0,0," driving trucks, visiting superbly rendered cities around europe and building the largest trucking company in a sim world, euro truck driver does all this and more. nothing compares to ets2 not that i have tried anything else, but why would i when ets2 ticks all the boxes i personally want (there other truck sim, american truck driver is also very good). it is also backed by a great development team who continuously update the game (for free) and provide new dlc that is interesting and adds flavour to the base game, it is my job away from work, and i don't mind that!"

2,2," ets 2 is a very good driving game but has somethings to add:visual damage.emergency vehicles can be seen on-duty.dynamic road event (crash or arrestation). by example: emergency services really doing smt about it, and police actually doing arrestation or others."

0,0, this game is extremly funny for 5 euros so buy this game!
0,0," did not expect this game too be so blissful and calming... but perhaps being from a somewhat chaotic 3rd world country with a plethora of idiotic reckless drivers caused said opinion. the title of the game says it all really, you are expected to drive cargo from a to b by truck properly"

2,2, i love just putting on my spotify playlist (wish there was integration with spotify in the in-game radio) and driving for hours doing my deliveries. great fun especially with a wheel + shifter combo.
1,0," i used to love this game, i have played thousands of hours on it. it used to be fun but there are now so many updates it's not worth it any more. every time i log on there seems to be another update which cancels your load and puts your truck back in your garage.also if you are running mods like pro mods, after an update it will break the game and you have to disable pro mods to log back on and sometimes running modded trucks can have the same effect.i run lots of other games with mods, all genuine bought from steam and updates don't break them so why do they break ets2?"
0,0, it's a good game if you like trucks. also i like. i recommend it to others.
0,2, sometimes you just need to chill... to forget about everything and calm down.and this game is just perfect for escaping reality and thinking that you are just a giant roadside rock.

0,2," euro truck simulator 2 - is an exciting simulation game that takes you into the world of trucking, driving heavy trucks on european roads.the game allows you to cross countries and explore new cities as if you were a real truck driver. you have to follow long routes, transport different cargoes, fulfill orders and earn money.one of the main aspects of the game is realism. truck driving is recreated with incredible detail, taking into account the physics of traffic, road conditions, and weather. while driving, you will feel the weight of the cargo and the realistic behavior of the vehicle.the graphics are stunningly beautiful and detailed. every city, every landscape and every road looks incredibly realistic. you will be able to drive through beautiful landscapes, pass by famous landmarks and enjoy the details of each location.euro truck simulator 2 is not only a game about driving, but also about a driver's career. you can create your own company, buy new trucks, hire drivers and expand your business opportunities.the game is also modifiable, allowing you to change and customize different aspects of the game. you can add new trucks, routes, landscapes, and more to expand the game world to your liking."
1,1," game deleted my progress despite saying ""saving"" and i couldn't load the game back to where i was, practically putting me back at the beginning of the game."
0,2," very relaxing game,i recommend"
0,0, man i love truckin'
0,0, nice game with the wheel its so good!!!!! you need to buy dlcs to make the game even better
2,0," i'm a 53 yro woman who's more partial to rpgs, but since purchasing ets2 i have been totally swayed and hooked on this driving simulator. the initial learning curve was a bit hard for me (tutorial is a bit lacking,) but i managed to muddle my way through the keyboard and mouse settings rather quickly. once i got the hang of the game, i couldn't help but sink a few more dollars on a g92 gaming wheel, and omg does this take the realism to the next level! i'm eyeballing the dlcs for ets2 and also ats (and subsequent dlcs for that one too.) unlike my sister who is a real life truckie, i know very little about big rigs, but if i can manage to sort things out, (and add mods to this game,) then anyone can. i just wish i knew how to drive a stick... i'd probably get a g driving force shifter. lol! highly recommend this game."
0,0, this game is good with mods and music on the background
0,0," this is the perfect game for hanging out with friends in a discord vc to, while i feel the dlcs are a bit pricy considering they are almost as much as the base game afaik, i highly recommend this to everyone who just wants to have some fun.also, if you have a usb steering wheel. use it. it's so worth it i promise."
0,0, god save me
