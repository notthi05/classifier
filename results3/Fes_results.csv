0,0, a great city builder/manager game!
0,0," this game still receives a big positive review, but i'm a bit disapointed with 2 things:- the last patch/update, it made the best mods uncompatible with the game, some of them like 81 tiles were essential"

0,2, pepper over some simple public services needs and that's that
0,0,"don't expect this game to go deep and don't rely the game's mechanics to be smart/logical, particularly traffic"
0,0, your homies don't even know how to use a roundabout proper
0,0, which is also where the fun with this game stops
0,1, it just stumbles way too often over it's own mechanics
0,2, you are basically relegated to fixing arguably non-sense issues and micro-manage instead of planning/designing a city

0,0,"also mods saved my life oml if you're struggling in your city, consider mods"

0,0, i really feel like recommending this game because it has almost everything a city manager should have
0,2," the game generally works fine and everything is working as expected, and you can fix many flaws, make the game harder and add content through mods and the workshop"
1,1,in the vanilla game (without mods) there's a bug that happens with water once your city becomes really big
0,0, if you're aiming at making a very big city you'll probably fall in this bug unless you install a mod that addresses it
0,2, citizens will become sick without any apparent reason
1,1, building more drain pipes and water towers won't fix it
1,0," even switching entirely from pumping water from a water source to using water towers won't fix that, so you're basically screwed and forced to abandon your city"
0,0,"i'm surprised developers haven't looked into that and that issue is still a thing, but as i said, as long as you install the proper mod the issue won't happen"
0,0, this game is nice.

0,0, a very fulfilling city building game
0,2," includes very granular controls, and allows you to include mods which elevate the level of gameplay significantly"
0,0," okay, i don't usualy write reviews, but i chose to (this time)"
0,0,i love this game
0,0, it's one of the best city builders i have played within the past decade
0,0," the other one is cities xl, which i played heavily before cities skylies came out (unfortunately that game, cities xl, is outdated and just wearing: not good for long play)"
0,2,"this game, however, if lively, bright, inviting, smooth, and fun"
0,0,"i know a lot of people have an issue with paradox's ""dlc policy"" but you're not required to buy dlc to enjoy this game"
0,0, the game itself is fun and has updates on its own
0,2," also, the game is open to mods, which means you can add assets and other things created by other fans of the game from the workshop without having to worry about the dlc"
0,0,"and i wonder jsut how many people may argue about the dlc may have bought an expansion pack for an online game (wow or any other,"
0,0, final fantasy 14 in my case)
0,0, i can't knock these worked on mini-expansions small prices when i spend $50 on an expansion for an online game that allows me to use 3 new jobs and travel to a new area
0,0,"even thought i will be right next to people who can access these things without me having them (meaning the $50 was just a glorified unlock code, essentially)i mean they could wait and make a massive expansion and release a fullsized expansion but i don't see the issue with sevelal small ""expansions"" called dlc"
0,2, dlc that one could wait until it goes on sale and buy them a bit along
0,0,and that is why i recommend this game
0,2, a company that continually wants to expand on their property to keep it alive
0,0," if you see it as them just being greedy, you're not oblidged to buy it, but it's clear that people are still buying them"
0,0, why? because they enjoy the game
0,0,that's the point of games
0,2, to enjoy them
0,2, why not have more things added to further that enjoyment
0,2," much less have stuff added that is official, stable, and compatable"
0,2,"or, if you're not happy with it, you're free to go buy the old and outdated city builders that avaiable on steam here"
0,0, simcity4 is available
0,0,but you'll never get to see any new content or enjoy any mods with that game
1,1, a good city builder but there is one problem i have with this game: endless errors when trying to place an airport.
0,0, this game is great if you're an engineer/surveyor.
0,0, its great!
1,1, crashes when i try to launch it and is the only game i own that won't run

1,1," nothing: various processes keep running, nothing displays anywhere ever, rebooting the computer requires manually killing the runtime processes with the task manager"
1,0," dox i know you're probably busy with cities skylines 2 and stellaris, but can you explain why does my game keeps getting stuck on the loading screen"
0,1," loads every asset, including unused ones, into ram whenever you try to go into a map"
0,0," this is the only game i have ever run into this with, that reeks of poor optimization/programming, because why do i need to load all 5 other maps when i'm only playing on 1 map"
0,0," if the game crashes and you have 16 gb of ram, this is the likely reason why, my old computer crashed all the time because of this"
0,0," haven't crashed yet on my new pc, however it still tries to take up 20+gb of ram"
2,0," 10/10 best city builder, but needs more roundabouts! xd"
0,0," good game for losing your mind to a city in the sky, so many ways to make a city without or with uniform."

0,0, new favorite game
0,0, a classic but still worth it. engaging and intelligent. always fun.

0,0, - mayor of los angeles
0,0, fun game but i dont want to spend like 400$ on a bunch of pixels
0,0, for the record i love this game and it's my go-to de-stressor in any situation
0,0, seeing how much it's grown since 2015 with all of the updates and expansions has been an incredible display of progressing a game from it's vanilla state
0,1,"but just skimming at the content section of the store page, there should not be $300+ worth of dlc"
0,0, we cannot keep letting paradox get away with their greedy practices when the sequel to cities: skylines finally comes
0,0, i love the game
0,0, have played it a lot
0,0,but
0,2,i need the mods from the workshop to be enjoying the game
0,1, and paradox keeps breaking the mods
0,2," again, and again"
0,0,"i stopped playing for a while, and gave it a try again"
0,1," but two days ago they updated the game again, and i can't play it"
0,0, it's like i am waiting for game 2 so i can play game 1 without any new gamebreaking updates
0,0,please stop ruining the game
0,0, it's a fantastic citybuilder game when i can play it with the tools i want to use
0,0, i wanted to build a car-free city but apparently that is too far-fetched of a fantasy for this game.

0,0, an amazing city builder -probably the best
0,0, definitely has a learning curve and costs a large sum of $$$ to get all the dlc
0,0," however i would say that the price is worth it and this game can provide you with hundreds of hours (i have played more than 29 hours in total, as i own the game on xbox as well)"
0,0, the community for the game is amazing and can help you learn the game in no time
0,0, 9/10

0,0, it's awesome
0,0, its pretty ok
0,0," very fun at start,base game kind of bland."
0,0, i hesitated buying this game for the longest time
0,0, if you grew up playing sim games like simcity then most modern citybuilders are pretty aweful and i usually avoid buying games with dlc
0,0, however i was really surprised at how well rounded and detailed this game is
0,0," after almost 2000hours of my life to this game, it is one of my favorites"
0,0," the industries dlc does need to be redone its really unbalanced, almost cheating, and supply/demand is just broken/nonsensical"
0,0," this game totally scratches the simcity itch, and it supports mods"
0,0, this game is nothing like the adds
0,0," i was playing and i made me best city and then the happiness went down, and everyone was sick and it all just started to crash and my city was destroyed"
0,0, over all2/10 do not recommend
0,0, love it. great city builder
0,0, the game is fun if you like buildings and making cities
0,0," it's certainly not perfect and often becomes traffic simulator, but it's the best city builder out there imo"
0,0, it is really fun to play
0,0," runs poorly, with workshop mods its playable and it became my favorite game."
0,0, v good
0,2, only play if you want to go insane
2,0, overall a great city builder but the original game should have included things like roundabout builder etc that you can get free as a patch
1,0," i bought this game and was excited to play it, but it will not open when i click play, it will say that its running but when i pull up task manager nothing shows as running besides steam"
0,0," googled it and no help, very disappointing"
1,1," game is suddenly crashing as it loads. at this point, just save your money and wait for c:s ii"
0,0, the best city planing game so far
0,0, its really cool to build a city

0,0," skylines2 has been announced though, so maybe take it easy on the dlc"
0,2, recommend
0,0, when your cities are skylines
0,0, good game
0,2, it's a very creative and fun game where you can control your own city to either lead it to destruction or prosperity.
0,2, you need to pay dlc to get all the achivements
0,0, i really recommend this game if you love the creativity of customizing a city
0,0," sadly, without the dlcs, the game is kind of bland so i do recommend finding a guide on the best dlcs to buy/find"
0,2, just make sure not to have too many because some computers can't handle too many dlcs
0,2," though at this point, i recommend waiting for cities skylines 2"

0,0," if cs1 is this good, cs2 is going to be amazing"
0,0, i cannot comprehend how one game can eat my entire ram
0,0, very relaxing but stimulating game. i cant wait to play the second one coming soon.
0,0, paradox insists on pushing more and more dlcs that do stuff already available through mods instead of starting a new with an updated engine like this game very clearly needs
0,0," was a good game when it came out and for the subsequent years, and nowadays it still is the top citybuilder but only because it has no direct competitors"
0,2, the joyless cash grab version of simcity 4
0,0, an amazing game to lose yourself into

0,0,it's so riddled with bugs and issues that it makes it so inhumanly infuriating to play that i almost requested a refund after over 2 months of playing it
0,0,i haven't done anything that would break the game

0,0, this game is perfect for creative types and those that like challenging game play

0,0,or maybe that's just a skill issue of mine
0,0," idk, i can't really say much about it"
0,2, give it a go when it's on sale or something
0,2, just everything other than controls

0,2, so real
0,0," very good game, everything is nicely detailed"
0,2," only problem is, that there are too many dlcs, which are very pointlessly placed (small details, some stuff that should be in base game)"
2,2," please incorporate built-in fillers such as plazas, concrete, cobbles, asphalt, etc"
2,2,", and include the ability to modify the plaza of an existing building, at least do it for cs ii"
0,2," in actual cities, you wouldn't find empty grass spaces between two high-rises"
0,0, starve your citizens!
0,0, probably my favorite sandbox/creative game ever along with the likes of minecraft
0,0,"been playing it since almost launch and keep getting addicted, well worth a buy - especially during sales"
0,0,"the only complaint really is the usual paradox interactive milking of dlc, so look for a list of the best dlc to get before buying any"
0,0, looking forward to the sequel when it does come!don't forget to have a decent amount of ram (16+) if you want to get a decent amount of addons
2,0," stop adding your launcher to games on steam! if i buy your game on steam, i don't want to buy a shortcut to your launcher just to launch the damn game"
0,0," the same thing happened to kerbal space program too, quit it"
0,0," it's a fun, strategy, big brain game innit"

0,0,"the game is incredibly feature-rich, even without the expansion packs and the exceptional work of the modders make the game even better"

0,2," industries, however, does"
0,0, don't get me started on the radio station add on packs
